				<div id="overview" class="tabs_content_bgtop">
					<p><img src="images/thumbnails/bhimtal/overview/bimtal_overview_main.jpg" align="right">The Smetacek family has a fascinating history; in the 1930s, Frederick Smetacek fled the Nazis and managed to board a ship sailing to India. He established himself as a successful businessman in Calcutta, where he married Shaheda Ahad, a descendant of famous warrior-king Tipu Sultan! They moved their family to the hills of Kumaon, bought a chunk of land on Jones Estate (a property spanning over a thousand acres, owned by the then magistrate, Colonel Jones), and started a holiday retreat to welcome diplomats from around the world. Their descendants now welcome travellers with the same warmth and love into the old-world charm of the original Smetacek family home.</p>
					<p>Bhimtal can look like an unattractive town at first glance; concrete construction lines the beginning of the slopes past the shores of Bhimtal Lake. However, once you drive past these initial deterrents, the Himalayas unveil a quaint hill station lined by charming mountain homes, surrounded by lush forests, and home to fascinating wildlife and local legends. Through these forests, you can stroll to the famous Methodist church of Sat Tal Christian Ashram Estate, the terraced farms in the valley below, and further to the pristine lakes of Sat Tal for an afternoon dip and picnic lunch.</p>
					<p>Wildlife enthusiasts and birdwatchers can spend hours in these ancient forests of cedar, oak and pine, spotting langurs, monkeys, deer, porcupines, peacocks, and various species of birds and butterflies; leopards, though much more elusive, have been spotted in the region by a lucky few! Adventure lovers can hike the lesser-known trails with the Smetacek boys, who have grown up in these mountains and among its wildlife. Or you can just lie back in the comfort of your colonial retreat, indulge your taste buds in the sumptuous colonial recipes of the house, and let your charming hostess fascinate you with her tales of yore.</p>

					<p><img src="images/thumbnails/bhimtal/stay/bimtal_stay_main.jpg" align="right" alt="The Tents">The Smetaceks’ family home retains its colonial, old-world charm, with its original mud-and-stone walls, 19th century glass panes in the doors, wood and tin roof, antique furniture, and ancient knick-knacks. The family makes every effort to preserve the forests and wilderness at and around the estate.</p>
					<p>Accommodation is provided in three comfortable bedrooms, all of which have rustic lime-washed mud-plastered walls that keep the rooms warm even in winter, wooden ceilings, antique paraphernalia, and attached (western-style) spacious bathrooms. Of the three rooms, one is a double bedroom with a sitting area, while the other two are family rooms – double bedrooms with a large annexe to comfortably accommodate four adults.</p>
					<p>The windows of the rooms overlook the wilderness that surrounds the home, and you can wake up to the sweet chirping of birds and even spot a pheasant or deer in the backyard in the early mornings.</p>
					<p>The common lounge area of the house features a sitting area around an old fireplace, complete with books and antique décor that has been in the family for generations. The outdoor sit-outs are great for relaxing in the sounds of nature.</p>

					<h4>Food</h4>
					<p><img src="images/thumbnails/bhimtal/food/bimtal_food_main.jpg" align="right" alt="Delicious Food in Breakfast">Paddy is an excellent cook, and preserves colonial recipes that have been in the family for a long time! Indulge in her home-cooked Continental or Indian fare, both of which comprise sumptuous vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared with locally grown or sourced ingredients.</p>
					<p>Breakfast is served in the verandah overlooking the garden, and typically consists of home-baked breads, buns and rolls fresh from the old Italian oven, served with home-made fruit jams, forest honey, and healthy spreads made with herbs from the garden. Made on request are apple pancakes, fruit crepes, and mushroom, cheese, herb or even jam omelettes!</p>
					<p>Lunch and dinner can range from traditional Indian dishes served with hot chapattis or rice, to continental dishes like fresh salads, pastas and baked vegetables, to barbeque dinners with jacket potatoes, barbequed snacks, pizza pockets, and herb and cheese cutlets. Remember to leave space for one of Paddy’s innovative and mouth-watering desserts.</p>
					<p>If you intend to spend the afternoon hiking in the wilderness or swimming in the lakes of Sattal, opt for a packed picnic lunch with pocket sandwiches, eggs, and seasonal fruits and berries – just what you need to complete a day out in the majesty of the Himalayas.</p>

<p class="quoteTxt">&ldquo;We indeed had a wonderful time in the homestay in Bhimtal. Smetacek’s family were just lovely and they took a great care of us.
We did enjoy the trip to the fullest and ended up staying another night. <br>
					We would love to explore more properties of yours.&rdquo;<br><br>

					<p>Over the years, the Smetacek family has tried to preserve their colonial way of life in the Kumaon Himalayas. The Smetaceks’ Colonial Homestay retains its original colonial character, with its thick mud walls, wooden ceilings, antique furniture, and family collectibles. Efforts are made to grow or source vegetables and herbs locally, and cook using traditional family recipes.</p>
					<p>A concentrated effort is made by the family to conserve the forests and wildlife of the surrounding region, by engaging locals on the importance of saving trees and not hunting wild animals, and even personally fighting forest fires.</p>
					<p>Below are some tips to travel responsibly while in Bhimtal:</p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Carry a good water bottle. Filtered water is available at the house for refilling your bottle. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
						<li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as possible.</li>
						<li>Do not litter or leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. Carry it to the cities where better waste management systems are in place.</li>
						<li>What you wear has an impact – environmentally and culturally – dress appropriately, especially when you visit the nearby villages.</li>
						<li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
						<li>Local food is great. Try it as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
						<li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs, especially in public places.</li>
						<li>Seek permission before photographing people, so as to respect their privacy.</li>
						<li>Do not pluck any plants &amp; flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife.</li>
