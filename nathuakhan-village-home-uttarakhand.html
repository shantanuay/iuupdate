          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs-overview-nathuakhan.jpg" align="right" alt="">As you pull up on to the side of the highway, you can see a winding village path going uphill along the property boundary. Take this little climb and you come in full view of the cottage, nestled amidst fruit trees and vegetable patches and the splendid colors of the seasonal flowers. You are atop a hill and around you are the rolling hills, the lower reaches of the mighty Himalayas.</p>
          <p>The cottage is warm and welcoming with a steaming cup of tea, much needed after the drive. Sit on the porch or under the shade of the plum tree and totally absorb your surroundings over your cuppa-chai. If the weather allows, you can set out for a walk down the village path to explore the forest trails that take you to the other side of the mountain. Alternately, you could just laze around with a book and more tea or coffee or watch a movie in the living room.</p>
          <p>The Nathuakhan market is a kilometer walk from the home. And once at the market crossing, on a clear day, you can see the most breathtaking view ever: the snow-clad Himalayan peaks right from Nepal to Himachal! They are all there, Trishul, Nanda Devi, Panchachuli. Evenings can be turned into soirees if a big group of guests visit, with bonfire and bar-be-que and your drink to go with it. </p>

A little more proactive guidance on the things to do when at the property would make the stay even more enjoyable. Looking forward to explore more India untraveled properties in the future. Thanks and keep up the good work!<br>

          <p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;It was very comfortable. Devika aunty and her staff were just what we needed. She's warm and makes excellent food. Being in the suite downstairs gave us privacy and a good view of the hills. The property is aesthetically done, matching my sensibilities. The attention to detail is what stole my heart, the refilling of tea and coffee every morning, the flexibility of breakfast hours (even though I saw it got inconvenient for her sometimes), sensitivity to privacy but openness to conversations.<br>
            <br>
            I'll be definitely recommending this place to my friends and family.<br>
            Thank you&ldquo;<br>

          <p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;The home stay was just what was needed - cozy and quaint and away from all the noise and crowd. The home is lovely and the accommodations for us surpassed our expectations completely. Loved the fact that there were 2 big and spacious rooms each with their individual washroom. Each of us had our own space and that was the whole idea for the getaway.<br>
            Especially love the small living area that was made at the end of the rooms with glass windows and a beautiful view - the perfect place to read or work!<br>
            <br>
            Aunty was a wonderful host and the 2 ladies there to help put with the meals and cleaning were extremely courteous and pleasant. Despite being a home stay in a small village it was surprising that rather than a fixed menu, we were offered a variety of cuisines to choose from for lunch and dinner !<br>
            <br>
            The food prepared was delicious and catered to our preference and taste. Got to experience local Kumaoni dishes as well and loved the flavor to their food. One has the option to borrow books or dvds or just sit out on the porch and enjoy the view over coffee and conversation.<br>
            <br>
            Piya was extremely helpful with directions and even suggesting pitstops for us along the way. Day 2 we drove up to Mukteshwar and Binsar and they called to make sure we were safe considering it was dark while we were on the way back.<br>
            <br>
            Overall, a beautiful and serene home stay with wonderful hosts, comfort food and a breathtaking view&ldquo;<br>

          <p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;Right from the time we entered to the time we left, there was no moment that we did not enjoy. Devika Aunty is a gem of a person. Her hospitality and her politeness makes her the best host.<br>
            <br>
            The place is BEAUTIFUL and it has all the ingredients to make your stay, a memorable one!! The food is the main USP. Devika Aunty ensures the variety and that you eat the mouth watering food till you have no more space.. And boy!! I wish I could eat more!!<br>
            <br>
            Our stay was amazing and a memorable one. Thank you all.. So much!!&ldquo;<br>

          <h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
          <p>Devika Aunty is largely involved with teaching the village kids (mostly English). Besides, being an avid knitter, she has over time employed the neighborhood women to knit mufflers, caps, leg warmers, socks etc. and has been able to sell these to visitors/guests. The home also harnesses rain water and has initiated talks with local authorities to facilitate proper garbage disposal to keep the surroundings green, which otherwise can becomes an eye sore. The Village home is run by an all-women team :) So it is a step toward empowering women! The organic farm at the village home uses minimal pesticides and no chemicals, growing everything from vegetables and fruits to herbs, and supplies most of the food served to travellers; the rest is sourced from local growers/ neighbors.</p>
          <p>Below are some tips to travel responsibly while in Nathuakhan:</p>
          <ul class="listing">
            <li>Carry a good water bottle. Filtered water from the mountain spring is available at the house for refilling your bottle. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
            <li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as possible.</li>
            <li>Do not litter or leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. Carry it to the cities where better waste management systems are in place.</li>
            <li>What you wear has an impact. Dress appropriately, especially when you walk into the villages.</li>
            <li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
            <li>Experiment with local and fusion food served from the host kitchen. Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
            <li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol, especially in public places. </li>
            <li>Seek permission before photographing people, so as to respect their privacy.</li>
            <li>Please do not pluck any plants and flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife</li>
          </ul>
