			<h3>Trip Overview</h3>
				<p>Deep  in the interiors of the remote North-eastern Himalayas, India Untravelled takes  you back in time in a village of small tea farmers near Darjeeling , and then  transports you on foot through breath-taking landscapes, to the lost kingdom of  Sikkim, the last state to be annexed by India in 1975.</p>
				<p>On  this intimate journey from <em>Darjeeling to  Sikkim: Introduction to the Northeast Himalayas</em>, you find yourself  plucking, rolling and sipping the world&rsquo;s finest organic teas on a family-run  mountain farm. You hike along undulating hills covered by tea plantations, surrounded  by majestic mountains, through charming villages, and finally across the  Rangeet River, to Sikkim.</p>
				<p>You  acquaint yourself with Sikkim in its laid-back capital city of Gangtok, staying  at a B&amp;B-café-bookshop, where coffee and conversations flow smoothly. Your  journey continues into the heart of West Sikkim, where you stay in a  beautifully restored heritage Sikkimese hut built with natural materials,  overlooking the snow-capped peaks of the Kanchendzunga Range (visible on clear  days) and set amid an organic farm of walnut trees, orange orchards and  seasonal vegetables.</p>
				<p>We  recommend that you ditch private cabs on this trail, and adopt the local mode  of transport – shared taxis, the fabric of life in this remote region. For INR  100-300, shared taxis give you a chance to interact with locals on long  journeys, and in a state with no public transport, are environmentally more  efficient than private taxis.</p>
				<p>There  is much to love on this trail. The mountains echo with chants and prayers from  Sikkim&rsquo;s many Tibetan Buddhist monasteries. The locals, although initially shy,  slowly warm up and are always up for a chat. The Sikkimese cuisine is an  indulgence in organic, healthy food. Momos, Wai-Wai (instant noodles), and the  locally brewed Hit Beer (must try!) are sold everywhere. And the serenity of  living in the lap of the revered Mount Kanchendzunga for a few days is  something that words can&rsquo;t describe.</p>

				<h3>Trip Highlights</h3>
				<p><strong>Pluck, roll and sip organic  tea</strong>: Staying  on a small tea farm in the mountains of Darjeeling district, you can trace the  journey of the world&rsquo;s finest tea from leaf to cup.</p>
				<p><strong>Local brews</strong>: Keep warm the way locals  do – sip from a bamboo stem with a bamboo straw, the warm <em>thomba</em>,fermented from  millets. Try the locally brewed Hit Beer in Sikkim.</p>
				<p><strong>Colonial tea estates</strong>:<strong> </strong>If Darjeeling conjures up images of sprawling tea estates for you,  you&rsquo;ll find yourself surrounded by one just minutes from your tea farm; only  you and the tea, as far as you can see.</p>
				<p><strong>Hike from Darjeeling to  Sikkim</strong>: A  mostly flat and downhill walk from your tea farm to a southern village of  Sikkim, along sprawling tea estates, rolling hills, dense forests and the  Rangeet River. You walk into Sikkim across a rickety bridge above the river!</p>
				<p><strong>The café culture of Gangtok</strong>: Stay in a B&amp;B with a  café and bookshop, and sample the alternative art scene of the city.</p>
				<p><strong>Traditional Sikkimese  homestead</strong>: Indulge  in the old-fashioned luxury of a traditional Sikkimese farming estate (stones  in the lowest layer, wood above, and a tin sheet cover), restored from the late  1800s.</p>
				<p><strong>Organic farm food</strong>: Indulge in seasonal  organic veggies and fruits grown on the farm, and cooked with Sikkimese  recipes. Try the famous Bhutanese Ema Datchi while you&rsquo;re at it!</p>
				<p><strong>Village walks</strong>: Discover Sikkim on foot -  quaint mountain villages (isolated homes as opposed to clusters), monasteries  hidden away atop isolated hills, valleys wearing colors in summer and a white  coat in winter.</p>

			<h3>Brief Itinerary</h3>
				<p>The <em>Darjeeling to Sikkim: Introduction to the  North-east Himalayas </em>trail is a perfect introduction to the natural beauty,  culture and life in this remote region. This trail can be customized based on  your travel days and interests.</p>
				<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> You need a medium level of  fitness to embark on this trip. Reaching the farm in Darjeeling involves  walking down for 10 minutes on a stone path, and the walk from Darjeeling to  Sikkim takes 5 hours (mostly flat and downhill, some uphill stretches). You&rsquo;ll  be helped with your luggage but need to carry yourself &#9786;</p>
				<p><strong>Days 1 &amp; 2: Farm-stay at an organic tea farm  in the Darjeeling district</strong></p>
				<p> The <em>Darjeeling to Sikkim:  Introduction to the North-east Himalayas </em> experience can start in Bagdogra, which is connected  to the rest of India by domestic flight connections and is the nearest airport to both Darjeeling and Sikkim. Or at the New  Jalpaiguri train station in Siliguri. From Siliguri, you can hop onto a shared  taxi, and drive 3 hours to Darjeeling town. You will be picked up from  Darjeeling town, to travel further to the village of Mineral Spring, an hour  away.</p>
				<p>Your first farmstay is quietly tucked away in a valley  surrounded by the mighty Himalayas, where locals organically grow tea, seasonal  crops and vegetables on small patches of land. Staying in a cozy hut designed  with local materials, tea bushes grow and are pruned and plucked right at your  doorstep!</p>
				<p>Spend your time at the farm plucking, rolling and  sipping the world&rsquo;s finest black tea. Take a dip in the natural in-house pool  on a warm summer afternoon. Chat with your host, who has grown up in these  mountains, about life in Darjeeling. Get a first hand perspective on the separatist  Gorkhaland movement. Read, write, paint, draw, do the things you love, in the quirky  outdoor cafe at the farm, with the mighty Himalayas forming an inspiring  backdrop.</p>
				<p>Walk a few minutes away from the farm to find yourself  in a sprawling tea estate stretching into the horizon. Go on a guided walk  along the hills slopes of Mineral Spring, stopping for traditional lunch in a  village home. Take a day trip to Darjeeling town and discover its sights if you  must. Or walk in the surrounding mountains, chat with the hill folk, shadow the  tea pluckers, refill that cup of tea, and reminisce about the colonial times  gone by.</p>
				<p><strong>*Day  3: Walk from Darjeeling to Sikkim</strong></p>
				<p> Partake  of one of the most unique (and local) experiences in the eastern Himalayas! You  walk from Darjeeling, along tea estates dotting the landscape, past charming  hill villages, through stunning mountain trails, into dense forests, across the  pristine Rangeet River, and on a rickety river bridge, to Sikkim. If you&rsquo;re  lucky and the skies are clear, you&rsquo;ll catch glimpses of the snow-capped  Kanchendzonga Range every now and then. This is a gentle walk, flat and  downhill in most parts, with only some uphill stretches, and takes 5 hours on  an average level of fitness. You cool your heels in the river, take photography  and resting breaks, and indulge in a packed picnic lunch along the way.</p>
				<p>In  the first village of Sikkim across the border, you taste your first plate of  momos and the locally brewed Hit Beer – indulgences that make the ache in your  feet worthwhile!</p>
				<p>A  taxi will meet you with your luggage at the border, and drive you to Gangtok.</p>
				<p>You  tuck in at a Bed &amp; Breakfast (B&amp;B) in quiet part of Gangtok, 10 minutes  away from the hustle-bustle of the city&rsquo;s happening MG Road.</p>
				<p><strong>Days 4 &amp; 5: Explore Gangtok</strong></p>
				<p>Thus begins your acquaintance with Sikkim. Your  B&amp;B is set close to one of Gangtok&rsquo;s quiet residential areas, and literally  at your doorstep is a charming bookshop and café, where you&rsquo;ll be served  breakfast. Browse through books by authors from Sikkim and the region, and  spend hours chatting with your host over delicious coffee and sandwiches – this  is your best chance to sneak a peak into Sikkim&rsquo;s alternative art scene and  discuss everything from local books and food to travel and politics!</p>
				<p>Over  the next two days, explore the sights and sounds in and around Gangtok. Walk to  MG Road for your first traditional Sikkkimese meal, find your way to a local  monastery in the late afternoon (usually 4pm) to join their prayers and chants,  drive to Sikkim&rsquo;s biggest monastery at Rumtek, catch a panoramic view of the  city from the Hanuman temple top, and treat yourself to hot chocolate and a  great view at Baker&rsquo;s Café. Get chatting with the friendly locals, and hear  about the transition of Sikkim from an independent kingdom to India&rsquo;s last  annexed state – stories that will soon be lost in time.</p>
				<p><strong>Days 6, 7 &amp; 8: Stay at a traditional  heritage house in West Sikkim</strong></p>
				<p>Hop on to a shared taxi from Gangtok in the morning or afternoon, and make  your way like the locals do, up the winding mountain roads to a small village  near Rinchenpong in West Sikkim.</p>
				<p>Villages in Sikkim typically comprise of individual homes scattered  across the mountain slope, and not clusters of homes together as in many other  parts of India. And so when you arrive at your estate, it&rsquo;ll be you with the  mountains, snow-capped on clear days, misty on others. Meet your host, who has  grown up on this very estate, believed to have been built in the late 1800s,  and transformed the surrounding land into an organic oasis of walnut, mandarin  and rhododendron trees, and seasonal veggies.</p>
				<p>Cozy up in the old-fashioned luxury of your hut, climb up to its small loft  to feel the tranquility of the mountains and spot colorful birds, indulge in  traditional Sikkimese dishes cooked from farm to table, chat with your friendly  host about life in these remote parts, walk down into the valley of red  rhododendrons for spectacular views of the mountains beyond, or just do nothing  in the lap of Mount Kanchendzonga (visible on clear days from the farm).</p>
				<p>Spend your time in West Sikkim exploring the surrounding villages and  monasteries on foot. Stroll back in time to traditional Bhotiya and Lepcha  houses, catch glimpses of everyday life in these isolated villages, chat with  the friendly locals, visit the local bazaar for a hot plate of maggi, join the  monastery chants in the afternoon and feel the mountain echo with prayers, spot  rare species of birds, and do day trips to the nearby villages of Yuksom and  Pelling if you like. But most of all, slow down, soak in the natural beauty,  let the calm of the mountains soak your soul, and fall in love with the simple  joys of life in Sikkim.</p>
				<p>On the last day of your trip, take a shared taxi to Siliguri to catch  your flight or train home, carrying with you fond memories and stunning  photographs of your journey from Darjeeling to Sikkim in the northeast  Himalayas!</p>
				<p><em>*Note: The  walk is only for Indian nationals as international tourists are not allowed to  cross into Sikkim from this point.</em></p>

				<h3>Location:</h3>
				<p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong></p>
				<p>The  best months to visit Darjeeling and Sikkim are from October to April, when the  weather is pleasant during the day, chilly at night, and chances of clear skies  are high. Nature is unpredictable, and whether you can see the snow-capped  Kanchendzonga Range or not, is really upto your luck! The locals expect the  clearest skies in October / November. Monsoons paint Sikkim a lush green with  seasonal waterfalls, but also bring leeches to the hills – so the months from  June to August are best for rain lovers.</p>
				<p><strong>Fitness</strong></p>
				<p>You  need a medium level of fitness to embark on this trip. Reaching the farm in  Darjeeling involves walking down for 10 minutes on a stone path, and the walk from  Darjeeling to Sikkim takes 5 hours (mostly flat and downhill, some uphill  stretches). You&rsquo;ll be helped with your luggage but need to carry yourself &#9786;</p>
				<p><strong>What to pack</strong></p>
				<p>Weather  in the mountains can be quite unpredictable. It&rsquo;s best to pack in layers, and  be prepared for warm, sunny afternoons as well as cold evenings. Carry good  walking shoes, umbrellas, sunhats, essential medicines, binoculars for  birdwatching, and a camera to capture some unforgettable moments. Don&rsquo;t forget  a good water bottle so you can refill filtered water at your accommodations  instead of buying plastic mineral water bottles.</p>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
				<h4 class="mrgT15">Things to note</h4>
				<ul class="listing">
					<li>Cash and ATMs:&nbsp;Only cash is accepted at the homestays. ATMs are  located close to bus stops and in the bigger towns.</li>
					<li>Food: Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian  food is available on this trail.</li>
					<li>Bathrooms:&nbsp;Each  room comes with an attached bathroom, running or bucketed hot water and western  style toilets.</li>

				<h3>Reviews</h3>
			<p class="quoteTxt"><br>&ldquo;All the home stays were beautiful .... Navin at the Darjeeling farm is an amazing host ... We had a great time.&rdquo;<br>
			<strong>~ Anvita Dasari, travelled with friend in June 2017</strong></p>
				<div class="sep"></div>
            <p class="quoteTxt ">&ldquo;Had a memorable holiday, thanks to you and all our hosts! This is one trip where I felt that everything was well managed end to end. I was particularly impressed by the pretrip experience, proactive updates, followups and planning - not many operators manage it so well prior to the trip. And the trip itself was fab! Stays well chosen, smooth transition from one to the next. Some details about each:
                <br>
                <strong>Tathagata farm:</strong> Lovely location, excellent hospitality and services, Navin and his team went out of the way to look into our every requirement.
                <br>
                <strong>Bookman's B&amp;B:</strong> Very well maintained rooms with all amenities. Pick-up could have been arranged with a driver who knew the place.
                <br>
                <strong>Yangsum heritage farm:</strong> This was a pleasant ending to the trip. A great stay in all respects, location, hospitality, services, warm and friendly people, delicious food, personal attention. Thendup is an excellent host and his team does a very good job of taking care of guests!
                <br>
                So, all in all, very impressed and would like to go on more similar trips with you in future.&rdquo;<br>
				<strong> ~ Sarita Dhillon, travelled with parents in March 2017.</strong></p>
				<div class="sep"></div>
            
			<p class="quoteTxt">&ldquo;Thank you so much for arranging everything. The three of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay at all the three places and our hosts were more than wiling to help us with whatever we wanted. The trail from Darjeeling to Sikkim was splendid and I am looking forward to more such trails. Overall, we had a great experience.&rdquo;<br>
				<strong> ~ Susan, travelled with friends in October 2014.</strong></p>
				<div class="sep"></div>
				<p class="quoteTxt mrgt25">&ldquo;The Northeast Experience was among the best trips I have ever taken in India. India Untravelled's careful curation of accommodation and activities enabled a rich, varied, comfortably-paced and unforgettable experience. Our group of three women enjoyed interacting with local hosts and guides, observing rural lifestyles and being close to some of the most pristine natural areas in India. The Darjeeling to Sikkim trek and the homestay in West Sikkim were the highlights of our trip, and we will recommend this experience to any adventurous and discerning traveller.&rdquo;<br>

				<h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
				<p class="mrgT25"><strong>How this trip makes a difference:</strong></p>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
				<ul class="listing">
					<li>The  farmstay in the Darjeeling district is on an organic farm, where all tea,  vegetables and herbs are grown organically. It has been set up by two brothers  from the village, working hard to augment farming incomes of the residents  through tourism.</li>
					<li>The  heritage estate in West Sikkim is run by a descendant of the family who  originally built it, and has lovingly restored it with locally sourced  materials, avoiding the carbon footprint of building from scratch.</li>
					<li>All  guided walks on this trail are with local guides, who have grown up in these  remote mountains and are turning to tourism to complement farming incomes.</li>
					<li>All  accommodations on this trail give you a chance to interact closely with the local  hosts and understand life (and how life has changed) in the region.</li>
					<li>We  recommend that you take shared taxis on this trail, to save the fuel  consumption and carbon footprint of private taxis, and to get entrenched in the  fabric of local life in these parts.</li>
					<li>The  accommodations on this trail are either run by or employ staff from the local  village communities to look after travellers, creating an alternate source of  income through tourism.</li>
					<li>Host  families on this trail are environmentally committed, with measures like  organic farming, volunteering, and restoration and conservation efforts in the  region.</li>
					<li>All  food provided in the accommodations is freshly prepared in the host kitchen,  using locally grown and locally sourced ingredients.</li>
					<li>The  revenues generated from this trip are reinvested to sustain efforts in organic  farming, as well as to further the cause of responsible travel in India.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
				<p class="mrgT25"><strong>How you can make a difference on this trip:</strong></p>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
				<ul class="listing">
					<li>Take the time to interact with your hosts and think of yourself as a  guest at a family home. Please don&rsquo;t expect room service!</li>
					<li>Carry a good water bottle and ask to refill filtered drinking water at  your accommodation. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
					<li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little  plastic as possible.</li>
					<li>Do not leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. Carry batteries and  other toxic waste back to the cities where waste management is in place.</li>
					<li>What you wear has an impact – dress appropriately.</li>
					<li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public  places.</li>
					<li>Try local food as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for  modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
					<li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs,  especially in public places.</li>
					<li>Seek permission before photographing people, so their privacy is  respected.</li>
					<li>Do not pluck any medicinal plants &amp; flowers, and do not disturb the  wildlife.</li>
