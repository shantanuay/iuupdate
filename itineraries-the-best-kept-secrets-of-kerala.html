                    <h3>Trip Overview</h3>
                    <p>India Untravelled invites you to leave behind Kerala’s tourist circuit and discover the picturesque countryside in the north of the state. Pamper yourself in a Kerala of virgin backwaters, misty tropical forests, and sandy white beaches
                        caressed by the waves of the Arabian Sea. Experience life in a postcard bamboo village, indulge your taste buds in the delicious local cuisine, wander along dense coffee, rubber and coconut plantations, and treat yourself to the
                        warm hospitality of your host families. On this trail, you witness the many faces of Kerala, and immerse yourself in its culture, traditions and crafts.</p>

                    <p>This itinerary takes you to small towns and villages in Wayanad and Kasaragod, where local families host you. You ditch popular tourism destinations in the south of the state.</p>

                    <p>The
                        <em>Best Kept Secrets of Kerala</em> itinerary starts on a coffee plantation among the tropical forests of the Wayanad district, and continues in a small village nestled in the Western Ghats and end your journey on a private island
                        by a gorgeous stretch of the backwaters.</p>

                    <h3>Brief Itinerary</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Day 1 &amp; 2: Homestay at a Coffee Plantation in Wayanad</strong>
                        <br> The Best Kept Secrets of Kerala itinerary can start in Calicut or Bangalore, both of which are well connected by international flights and trains, and have frequent buses plying to Wayanad. Car transfers can also be arranged
                        from other parts of Kerala.
                        <br>

                        <br> Wayanad’s hilly district is a treat for nature lovers, adventure enthusiasts and photographers, with its dense tropical forests interspersed with plantations of rubber, coconut, coffee and tea. Your first homestay is located
                        in a small town in Wayanad, where you stay on a coffee plantation with a native Wayanadi family, in a bamboo cottage raised on stilts.
                        <br>

                        <br> Spend your two days here getting to know your host family, indulging in delicious home-cooked North Kerala cuisine, and strolling along or volunteering in the coffee and rubber plantations in your backyard. Spend some quiet
                        time in your balcony, hearing the orchestra of birds, and spotting fireflies in the dark.
                        <br>

                        <br> Explore the hilly treasures of Wayanad by car. You could choose to step back in time at the pre-historical Edakkal Caves, visit one of the last standing tribal settlements at Chekadi, spend a late night camping at a forest
                        settlement, or climb the spectacular Chembra Peak, home to a heart-shaped lake. You can also opt for an early morning deep forest trek in the core zone of a wildlife sanctuary, or a jeep safari through the forest. </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Days 3 &amp; 4: Traditional Village Homestay in Wayanad</strong>
                        <br> Drive through the scenic terrain of Wayanad (1-1.5 hours), to the small picturesque village of Thrikkaipetta, nestled in the Western Ghats and surrounded by rice paddies and banana &amp; coconut plantations. The craftsmen
                        and women of Thrikkaipetta specialize in bamboo handicrafts, earning it the nickname &ldquo;Bamboo Village&rdquo;.
                        <br>

                        <br> Your next homestay is with a native family in a traditional village home at Bamboo Village, where you get a cosy room to yourself, equipped with basic urban facilities including a western-style bathroom. Indulge in the warm
                        hospitality of your hosts, soak in the spectacular landscape of the village, and make yourself at home on the postcard countryside of North Kerala.
                        <br>

                        <br> Spend your two days experiencing village life, interacting with your host family and other residents of the village, strolling around the village plantations, and hiking in the surrounding hillocks. Your host family will be
                        happy to have an evening of informal music and dancing for you, sharing their traditions and folklore with you, and learning about yours. If you&rsquo;re travelling in a big group, you could also opt for a cultural folk performance
                        by a group of village artists and shake a leg with them.
                        <br>

                        <br> If you feel you haven&rsquo;t seen enough of Wayanad in the first two days, you could sign up for a half day or full day cycling trip through the sunny plains, fields, lakes and temples of South Wayanad.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Days 5 to 7: Private Island Stay in Kasaragod</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>You spend your last three nights in a small piece of paradise,&nbsp;in a laterite stone cottage with an open-rooftop shower and traditional Kerala-style tiled roof, overlooking an expanse of backwaters as open as a river, dotted on
                        the far end with palm trees. You can spend your time interacting with your personable host, treating yourself to finger-licking good food, and lounging in your balcony or on one of many hammocks across the island, soaking in the
                        spectacular views of the backwaters and watching fishing boats go by. </p>

                    <p>You can swim in the backwaters (they are that clean!), go on a boat ride along the coconut-fringed countryside, and indulge in a beach picnic on virgin sandy beaches across the coast. You can opt for a traditional Ayurvedic massage
                        on the island, or take a trip to see mussel farming in the surrounding waters. </p>

                    <br>

                    <br>Firstly, I have loved all the trips that I did with India Untravelled (Sikkim, Darjeeling, Spiti and Kerala), you guys do it great! <br> I loved every bit of Kerala itinerary - Each of the three locations were distinct and had
                    its own beauty and story to tell. I loved exploring, village walking with absolute no fear or anxiety of being a solo traveler. </br>
                    Homestays (including Oyster Opera) were absolute delight with great hosts, delicious food and always willing to help. They made me feel so comfortable and guided to make the best of the three days. </br>
                    The only suggestion I would have is to the itinerary - the travel from Bamboo Village to Kasargod is too long (I got there in 6 hours), some flexi option if the travellers dont want to travel that far for the next destination. May be something in Kannur
                    and Kasargod together. Or even combine Madikeri, Kannur and Kasargod. </br>
                    When I reached Bamboo Village, there were no guides available those two days. Although I wasn't sure, where to start, eventually I loved exploring the place on my own and dont have any complaints around it.</br>
                    Thank you so much for helping plan this on such a short notice. I look forward to many more trips in the future. </p>

                    <div class="sep"></div>
                    <p>&quot;We had a really wonderful time on our trip through Kerala. There is so much to say, but I'll highlight a few of the best parts --
                        <br> - The food! Especially as vegetarians/vegans, we were blown away by how great we ate throughout the trip. Oyster Opera was particularly amazing, as was the homecooked meal at our stay in Bamboo Village.
                        <br> - The people! It was such a pleasure to get to meet and speak with so many different and interesting people throughout the trip. Staff, guides, other guests, and local residents who dropped by were all a real pleasure to get
                        to know. I enjoyed picking our hosts brains in Bamboo Village and Treasure Trove about village life and the agricultural sector.
                        <br> - The beach. Both Oyster Opera and especially the Kannur beachstay were peaceful and relaxing beach getaways. The beaches were clean and the water was warm.
                        <br> - When we first got to Bamboo Village, we were a bit nervous there wouldn't be much to keep us occupied. But then we took a full day tour with a local guide who was amazing -- he knew every tree and plant, took us to a great
                        little coffee shop, and introduced us to the folks who ran the Bamboo Village work. It exceeded our expectations.
                        <br> - The coffee. I don't even drink coffee, but I couldn't get enough, especially at our two stays in Wayanad. Amazing.&quot;</p>

                    <div class="sep"></div>
                    <p>&quot;Thanks so much for organizing such a lovely trip for us. The hosts at both the places were truly delightful people to meet. My family had a great time. Thanks for all your planning.&quot;</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>~Rachna, travelled with her family to Wayanad and Kasaragod, in Sept 2014.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <div class="sep"></div>

                    <p>&quot;Thank you for arranging this trip, we had a great time in Kerala. This program was exactly what we were looking for. Here's a quick rundown on our experiences&hellip;</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Meenangadi</strong>
                        <br> Sunil and Reena were great hosts. The cabins were very nice and Reena's cooking was excellent. We found them welcoming, happy to talk about the area and their lifestyle, and helpful in arranging transportation to some of the
                        surrounding areas (Edakkal Caves, Kuruva Island, Meenangadi town). We would recommend this place to our friends and family.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Thrikkaipatta</strong>
                        <br> We had a mixed experience in Thrikkaipatta. We really liked the tour guide Anoop and spent two days with him. We walked around the town with him on the first day and on the second day we climbed the peak in Thrikkaipatta (the
                        1,500 m peak). We found him easy to get along with and willing to spend as much time with us as we wanted. He was also very knowledgeable about the village and the area. Our homestay, however, did not meet our expectations. We
                        found it difficult to develop a relationship with Sumesh and thought he was overly promotional with the "Bamboo Village" project. He seemed more interested in advancing this initiative and promoting the village than making us feel
                        welcome. This made us feel uncomfortable with our stay. We also felt that the food was merely "okay" (the rice and other food was cold) and unfortunately not up to the hygienic standards of the other homestays. Also: they didn't
                        have bicycles and Sumesh said that other people had requested this. This was one of the activities that we saw on your itinerary and were looking forward to doing. We would recommend that our friends/family spend time in Thrikkaipatta,
                        but we would not recommend this homestay. </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Kannur</strong>
                        <br> As you said, we did leave one day early from Thrikkaipatta when we found out that family friends were in town and lived in Kannur. We ended up staying at our friends' house while we were in Kannur but spent an afternoon and
                        an evening at Blue Mermaid. The property and beach were beautiful and Indu's cooking was very good. We found the experience more touristy and slightly less personal than in Meenangadi, but overall our time there was comfortable.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Cheruvathur</strong>
                        <br> We had a very good experience at Oyster Opera and found Mr Gul very welcoming. It was a nice peaceful resort and good way to end the trip. We would recommend to friends/family.</p>

                    <p>Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the trip and had a great time experiencing the people, food, lifestyle, culture and landscape in Kerala.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;Thank you immensely for arranging such an amazing trip through Kerala. I had a blast and thoroughly enjoyed my stay everywhere. Each place was unique and absolutely amazing. You absolutely picked the most perfect places everywhere.&quot;

                    <br>

                    <p>&quot;The trip was great. Thanks for collating such a brilliant itinerary. I could do hills, waterfall, beach, back waters all in one-shot. Almost a Perfect vacation…
                        <br> The home stays are really good and well chosen. We received a warm welcome at all the places with no glitches… The hosts are attentive to all the requests throughout the stay.</p>

                    <p>I would specially mention Mr Gul from Oyster Opera as my son got sick and he and his staff was very considerate and made sure I got whatever was required to attend him.</p>

                    <p>Strangely I got a couple of questions from hosts if I work with you folks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        <br> Perhaps both of you made definite they I am taken care… Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Appreciate your patience in setting up my itinerary and answering all my queries.
                        <br> Would certainly love to do more of the India untraveled&hellip;&quot;</p>

                    <div class="sep"></div>

                    <br>

                    <p>&quot;Louis and I are safely home and wanted to say thank you for organising the second part of our wonderful Kerala experience, we absolutely loved it.</p>

                    <p>Our first homestay in Bamboo village was great with a really lovely family. The food, cooked by the grandmother, was absolutely delicious and was one the highlights of the trip. Anup, our guide around the plantations was very knowledgeable
                        and friendly and added a huge amount to our stay. Just to note our hosts asked for feedback and I suggested that 100% cotton sheets are very much appreciated by travellers from Europe.</p>

                    <p>The next stop at Treasure Trove was charming again, our room comfy and the food delicious, we really enjoyed going on a walk with our host Sunill and we took a trip up to the caves - a proper Indian family experience.</p>

                    <p>Sadly as you know due to the travel distances we didn't get to Kasaragod but ended our stay at The Blue Mermaid. It might be worth mentioning that it felt a little more like a small hotel than a homestay with several other guests,
                        not a problem but unexpected. Our hosts were very friendly and helpful (as was everyone on our entire stay - the welcome we got everywhere was humbling!) The food was fine but nowhere near as good as our other stays however it
                        was an lovely location right on the beach and backwaters.</p>

                    <p>As a final note I was wondering if it might be useful for your travellers to have a little more information prior to leaving in order to prepare and look forward to their trip. I would have liked to have had some advice about tipping
                        and other small things such as we learnt about not to put loo paper in the toilet - sounds obvious now but didn't occur to me until there! The only other thing is Louis and I had no photocopies of our passports and visas which
                        was a problem at Bamboo Village as our hostess had to spend a day at a police station sorting it out. </p>

                    <p>Wishing you all the best for 2014 and again thank you.</p>

                    <div class="sep"></div>

                    <br>

                    <p>&quot;I had a really fantastic time on my trip! Each home stay was quite unique and it gave me the chance to see different sides of Kerala, the backwaters, tea plantations etc. All the hosts were so hospitable and went to great efforts
                        to make me feel safe and comfortable, which was especially helpful because I was a bit apprehensive about travelling alone! I felt that that Bamboo Village home stay was maybe not of the same calibre as the other home stays, where
                        I felt a bit more comfortable making my own plans and had my own space. But certainly it was an interesting experience! I would have found it very helpful to have an estimate for how much money to take with me (both as a general
                        kitty and also for transport eg car transfers), especially given that ATMs are few and far between! Admittedly I should have asked, I didn't even think of it..! But overall very well organised and I had such a great time, so thank
                        you!!&quot;

                    <br>

                    <p>&quot;Besides the beaches, sunrises and sunsets, I will remember the trip more for the hospitality of our cheerful and chatty host, Indu. Her willingness to help stood out during the entire duration of our stay, all we had to do was
                        give her a shout. Since we are pure pure vegetarians, we had some problems with non veg food being prepared in the same kitchen, but she was kind enough to listen us out and prepare dishes according to our wishes.
                        <br>

                        <br> Overall, the trip was wonderful and one that was long due for us, hence we enjoyed it even more. We payed a visit to the nearby temples and had nice walk-throughs, through the local settlements of the town. Missed watching
                        theyyam and backwater boating though, will keep these and more for next time.
                        <br> Thanks once again for everything, also for extending the trip, this is one gesture we highly appreciate and are grateful
                        <br> for. &quot;</p>

                    <div class="sep"></div>

                    <p>&quot;Wayanad:&nbsp;Our hosts, Sunil and Reena and their two beautiful children were warm and hospitable. Food consisted of simple but delicious Kerala food served in the main house.&nbsp;The cottages, built by Uravu, a small scale
                        bamboo industry in Wayanad, have all the modern amenities and a nice bamboo balcony surrounded by a canopy of trees where one can just sit and listen to the chirping of the birds and see the sunlight filtering through the trees.
                    </p>

                    <p>Kannur:&nbsp;The golden sands and the sparkling sea welcomed us and we spent most of the day at the beach. The food at Blue Mermaid was authentic, lip smacking Kerala food and had a decent spread. </p>

                    <p>Kasaragod:&nbsp;The beauty of the landscape cannot be described in words and the photos possibly depict a little of what we actually saw. The cottage with its stone steps almost kissing the backwaters, with a lazy hammock swinging
                        between coconut trees was a dream come true.&quot; </p>

                    <p>&quot;As with any genuinely engaging place, you can spend a week in each of these locations alone and still barely scratch the surface of what Northern Kerala has to offer.
                        <br>

                        <br> The coffee plantation itself is a fun place to hang around; you're housed in a bamboo cottage, by the excellent host Reena, treated to a cicada orchestra and can even take in the coffee harvesting if the right season. In Charvattur,
                        near the town of Kasargod, the very personable host, G. S. Gul offers 10 cottages, including two houseboats, spread out across 24 acres of backwater. You could go canoeing in a pond built specially for it, be ferried out to a comfortable
                        area to swim in the waters or even visit the beautiful Bekal fort nearby, but all of those activities are simply an excuse to work up an appetite for the incredible food on offer here. &quot; </p>
