				<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p><img src="images/wah/overview.png" align="right" alt="The Lodge, Palampur">Wah Tea Estate has been part of the Prakash family since 1953. The previous owner, Sir Sikandar Hayat–Khan was the son of the Nawab of ‘Wah’, a town in Pakistan, from which the estate derives its name. The estate is one of the largest manufacturers of tea in the Kangra region. The teas are completely pesticide free, and carefully hand–plucked.<br>
					The Lodge came into existence when the owners decided to build themselves a home at the estate They were inspired by the local artisan’s craftsmanship with mud, wood and stone and decided to put their skill to use. The river stone and slate is hand chiseled and crafted to give it the feel of the local Kangra architecture. The bricks used to build the cottages are from the mud which was excavated when the foundation was being built. These bricks are all naturally dried in the sun. Even the white colour of the walls has been done with a natural formula, after extensive research on homes around the world.<br>
					The wood used at the lodge is originally from the Old Palampur Courthouse, which was demolished to be rebuilt a few years ago. Roof lining details, banisters from witness stands, and even whole doors and windows are originally from the Old Courthouse. Rest of the wood is pine and cedar from the Estate, in place of which multiple trees were planted.</p>

					<h3>Stay</h3>
					<p><img src="images/wah/stay.png" align="right" alt="The homestay has six rooms to be given out to guests">
					The homestay has six rooms to be given out to guests. The rooms are tastefully done, without compromising on the eco friendliness, which is the underlining theme at the lodge. All rooms have attached washrooms. The rooms overlook a beautiful garden which has a variety of plants and trees and also serves as a beautiful setting for meals in the open and of course the Bonfire or Bar-be-que at nights. Private sit-outs can be arranged for guests outside of their rooms or in the garden.</p>

				<h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
					<p>The Prakash’s are highly inclined towards Eco friendly practices both at the lodge as well as in the Teas Estate. The Lodge was built with the aim of providing a luxurious stay in the tea estate without harming the environment in any way. The villas at The Lodge are made of mud, slate and wood. The food prepared at the lodge is locally grown. Most ingredients are from the kitchen garden and the green house, both of which are completely organic.</p>

					 <p>The hosts also invest in cooperative farming, the tea estate workers have been given plots of land and seeds to grow their own produce. Only what is needed for The Lodge (less than 10% of what they grow) is requested from them, rest is for them to sell or use as they see fit. The Lodge has also provided for job opportunities for the locals. All the workers in the garden, kitchen and housekeeping are from the neighboring villages and have been trained on the job by the hosts and the Manager, Nikita Patel.</p>

					<p>Below are some tips to travel responsibly while in Palampur:</p>

					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Carry a good water bottle. Refill it at the homestay. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles. The Lodge provides filtered water to all guests.</li>
						<li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as possible.</li>
						<li>Do not litter or leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. </li>
						<li>What you wear has an impact. Dress appropriately, especially when you walk into the villages.</li>
						<li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
						<li>Experiment with local and fusion food served from the host kitchen. Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
						<li>Seek permission before photographing people, so as to respect their privacy. </li>
						<li>Please do not pluck any plants and flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife.</li>
						</ul>
