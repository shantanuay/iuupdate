					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs_overview_bamboo_village_wayand.jpg" alt="The day begins at Bamboo Village" align="right">Quietly nestled in the Wayanad district of North Kerala, Thrikkaipetta is a charming little village sprinkled with rice paddies and plantations of banana, coconut, coffee &amp; rubber, surrounded by the picturesque backdrop of the Western Ghaats. Besides farming, its residents have mastered the art of beautiful handicrafts, earning it the nickname, Bamboo Village. Seven host families in the village have now opened up their humble but artistically designed homes to travellers, who they lovingly take care of like their own family. Living in Bamboo Village for a few days feels like discovering a whole other universe; you can walk for hours along the village, soaking in its lush greenery and experiencing its modest farming lives, treat yourself to delicious home-cooked food or tea at the village stall, hike into the surrounding hills, volunteer with household chores, interact with the gifted bamboo craftsmen &amp; women, participate in the musical &amp; cultural festivities of your hosts, and escape into the simplicity of life on the countryside.</p>
					<p>If you decide to venture out of the village, the tropical forests and hillsides of Wayanad have plenty for you to explore. You can cycle along its gentle slopes or its more rugged terrains, discovering waterfalls, small ponds and lakes, stretches of the colourful tropical forests interspersed with rubber &amp; coconut plantations, and ancient temples. Or you can drive to the pre-historical Edakkal Caves, boat along the Kalapuzha Dam, visit the verdant tea plantations, and bathe in the Soochipara waterfalls. Before you know it, the indulgent hospitality of your hosts at Bamboo Village will draw you right back.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Our hostess was loving and cooked whatever we asked for; her interaction with our kids made us feel at home. The travel guide took us around places and kept sharing intersting information about Wayanad district. We really enjoyed the trip. Thanks for organizing the pleasant trip.&rdquo;<br>

					<p>&ldquo;I had such a nice time, it wasn't what I expected but I'm finding that nothing in India really is. The food was great, the local people friendly, and Daniel made a map for me every day to see other places in the region. I am always nervous in new places, and especially in India as a solo woman traveller but found no problems and felt completely safe. I'm very grateful to Daniel and Reena for their hospitality and graciousness. Everyone was very helpful when my travel plans and arrival didn't work as planned as well. <br>
						<br>
						I will mention that the lock on the door to my room didn't function--the door had warped or changed from the weather and didn't close completely. I realized it wasn't an issue after spending more time with the family, I was just a little anxious at the start. Everything was so great! Daniel even let me accompany him to a wedding for photography, a truly unique experience, as was church with reena.&rdquo;<br>

					<p>&ldquo;We had a  wonderful holiday in Kerala. Thrikkaipetta was the highlight of our trip.<br>
						We enjoyed the bus journey into Wayanad but  the arrival at Kochupurakkal Homestay was like arriving in paradise with  butterflies on the flowers and birds in the trees. After the incessant noise of  the road journey the homestay's location on a quiet lane in front of padi  fields and a steep, misty, forested mountain was a complete contrast.<br>
						<br>
						Eliyamma and  'Baby' and their son Varghese made us very welcome. Our room was comfortable  and spotlessly clean. For four days we enjoyed learning about life in Kerala, and  Thrikkaipetta in particular, through the many discussions we had with our  hosts. To experience this was enormously enriching and gave us so many insights  into how the village runs and more generally into family life in Kerala. <br>
						<br>
						The food they  cooked for us was outstanding. It all tasted wonderful and was perfectly  cooked. The meals consisted of so many beautifully cooked Keralan dishes.  Eliyamma uses many of her own ingredients, fruits, spices and vegetables, grown  either in her garden around the house, in the plot across the lane, in the yam  field up the hill or her padi some distance away. Curd came from the cows in  the cowshed next to the house. Kate spent one evening with Eliyamma and Baby in  the kitchen writing recipes for these excellent dishes.<br>
						<br>
						Raju who lives  along the same lane was our guide for three days of walking around  Thrikkaipetta. He has a great amount of detailed knowledge about the village.  We chose to spend all of our time locally rather than travel to attractions  further afield. This was because we valued so much learning in depth about  Thrikkaipetta and because Raju is so good at guiding and explaining. He knows  many people in the village so we regularly stopped and talked to other people.  We loved the landscape that Thrikkaipetta is set in. We walked along footpaths  and lanes through tea, rubber, coconut and areca plantations as well as forests  and padis. We went to the GUP school, the workshops and shop at Uravu, Shiva  temple and climbed to the viewpoint on Manikunnumala Mountain. Kate joined in  with the children singing at Anganvadi. 2013 has been such a heavy monsoon that  everywhere was lush and verdant and the streams bubbling with water. We enjoyed  experiencing the downpours and went everywhere with umbrellas.<br>
						<br>
						One evening P P  Daniel and Sumesh came to visit. It was interesting to hear about Kabani.  Sumesh described the plans to extend the responsible tourism homestay scheme to  other locations. We admired his understanding and dedication.<br>
						<br>
						We reached  Thrikkaipetta from Kochi by train to Nilambur and then by bus through the  forest to Meppadi. After Thrikkaipetta we went by bus to Thirunelli where we  enjoyed more excellent walks. We then left Wayanad by bus to Kannur which was  another very scenic journey.<br>
						<br>
						Thank you for your part in enabling us to get so  much out of our holiday in Kerala.&rdquo;</p>

					h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
					<p><strong>How a visit to Bamboo Village makes a difference:</strong></p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Bamboo Village is a community-based tourism initiative started by two local organizations – Uravu and Kabani – and aims to provide an alternate source of income to the residents of Thrikkaipetta, through tourism.</li>
						<li>The homestay program includes hospitality training for the local residents, and homestays are chronologically rotated among the host families to provide an equal opportunity to host guests.</li>
						<li>Greener means of transport, like walking and cycling are encouraged, local guides are employed, and raw ingredients for meals are locally sourced from the village as much as possible.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mrgT25"><strong>How you can be more responsible on your trip:</strong></p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as possible.</li>
						<li>Do not leave behind any non-biodegradable waste, like plastic and batteries.</li>
						<li>What you wear has an impact – environmentally and culturally – dress ethically and appropriately.</li>
						<li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
						<li>Carry a good water bottle. Filtered water is available at the homestays for refilling your bottle. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
						<li>Local food is great. Try it as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
						<li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs, especially in public places.</li>
						<li>Seek permission before photographing people, so their privacy is respected.</li>
						<li>Do not pluck any plants &amp; flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife.</li>
