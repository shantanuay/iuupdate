					<h2>June 2013: Kinnaur and Spiti Trip, Himachal Pradesh</h2>

					<p class="padT20"><strong>About The Trip</strong></p>

					<p dir="ltr">In June 2013, we invited travellers to journey with us through the stunning Kinnaur valley and the cold mountain desert of Spiti, nestled in the high Himalayas of India, in Himachal Pradesh. We experienced life in the highest inhabited villages in the Himalayas, were awed by fascinating Himalayan landscapes, explored centuries old Buddhist trails in the region, spotted endangered mountain flora &amp; fauna, and helped conserve the delicate ecology of the valley.</p>

					<p>The Spiti and Kinnaur Safari Trip began in Shimla and took our travellers through the stunning and graphic valleys of the Sutlej, Baspa, Spiti and Pin rivers, and up and over the majestic Rohtang and Kunzum passes. During this trip, we travelled into the spectacular valley of the Sutlej River in Kinnaur. The mighty Kinner Kailash kept us company in Kalpa, and the enchanting Baspa valley was the perfect place to rejuvenate. While in Spiti, we journeyed through some of the worlds highest villages, visited ancient monasteries (including an over 1000 year old monastery), experienced the Spitian way of life through traditional homestays, and got an insight into Spiti’s history, culture and folklore.</p>

					<p class="mar0"><strong>The revenues generated from the trip are being used  to:</strong></p>

					<ul class="listing">

						<li>Sustain the development initiatives of Spiti Ecosphere in the region.</li>

						<li>Support the livelihoods of homestay owners and trained tourism services providers (yak owners, guides, drivers) in the highest villages of the region.</li>

						<li>Offset the carbon footprint generated by the trip through investment in renewable energy initiatives in the region by Spiti Ecosphere.</li>

						<li>Further the cause of socially responsible travel by India Untravelled</li>

					</ul>

					<p  class="padT15 mar0"><strong>Trip  Reviews:</strong></p>

					<p class="padT15 mar0">  &ldquo;I’m still relishing the memories of Spiti and the wonderful people I met on this trip. The Kinnaur &amp; Spiti jeep safari had been the best of the journeys I have undertaken till yet. I never expected the trip, especially the hotels &amp; homestays to be as good as they were. The rooms in all the hotels were very neat and clean, especially bathrooms, and all of them had amazing views. The best was in Kalpa and Dhankar. The homestays in Demul &amp; Komic too were beautiful. It was wonderful to put up with the locals of some of the remotest villages in Asia and experience their routine life. Chhering (our guide ) was par excellence. He was genuinely concerned about everyone on the trip and looked after each one of us personally. Everyone enjoyed his company and all the stories he told us about Spiti and its people. Driving in this part of Asia is one of the toughest things to do but Gatuk (our driver) was simply superb at it. A highly recommended journey for anyone who wants to try something different.&ldquo;<br>

					<p class="padT15 mar0">&ldquo;I loved the homestays. It felt great to stay with the locals. My favourite hotel was in Dhankar. Amazing views and awesome staff. Special mention of our Spitian guide Chering .He was a really nice person who really cared about our welfare. Overall amazing trip.Travel was strenuous, so can suggest 2 days halt at some places. Would want to volunteer at Ecosphere in future. They do amazing work.&ldquo;<br>

					<p class="padT15 mar0">&ldquo;The trip was excellent. The guide named Cherring was very good and helpful. He was very genuine and caring. The car Innova and the driver named Gatok were also very good. The driver and the guide went out of their way and helped us for our needs. The scenery was pretty breathtaking. The people of Spiti were very kind and loving. They welcomed us with open hearts. The places to stay were pretty decent and clean.&ldquo;<br>
