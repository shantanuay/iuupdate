					<p>Spiti is a mini paradise on the shore of the  gushing Spiti River, in the backdrop of snow-hooded, mist-covered Himalayas. Bordering  Tibet in the east &amp; Ladakh in the north, Spiti offers a rare experience of  discovering life in the high Himalayas. The introspective winters of Spiti make  it a land of many legends, and its strong Buddhist influence is evident in the  hospitality and warmth of its people.</p>
					<p>As you build your own trails in the valley with  Spiti Ecosphere, you can trek &amp; bike through its breath-taking landscapes  and let the grandeur of the mighty Himalayas leave you in awe, draw conviction  from its high-altitude monasteries &amp; nunneries, discover its unique kaleidoscope  of colours, dances &amp; festivals, revel in the theatre art of the Bhuchens (a  rare sect of wandering lamas), and rejoice in Spiti’s elusive wildlife, flora  &amp; fauna. Assertive as it might sound, Spiti has a way of connecting with  its travellers that is hard to describe.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/img-spiti-accomodation.gif" align="right">Depending on the trail you'd like to follow, accommodation can be provided in homestays, guesthouses, or alpine tents.</p>
					<h4>Homestays</h4>
					<p>The most fulfilling away of immersing yourself  in the culture of Spiti is to live with a resident family in one of its many  villages. The Himalayan Homestays program developed by Spiti Ecosphere, has a selection of homes in the villages of Langza, Komic, Demul,  Lhalung, Dhankhar and Mikkim, which offer clean &amp;  comfortable rooms to travellers, together with the unique opportunity to bond  with the home owners, savour home-cooked Tibetan delicacies, and interact with  the Spitian way of life.</p>
					<p>Spiti Ecosphere’s development endeavours in the  region have equipped many of these homestays with solar lights &amp; geysers,  and dry-decomposing toilets that are environmentally friendly and uniquely  Spitian. Hot water can be provided on request.</p>
					<h4>Guesthouses</h4>
					<p>Long-term accommodation can be arranged as a mix  of homestays or in nominally priced guesthouses. The guesthouses offer options  of single or double rooms and western-style toilets &amp; bath with running hot  &amp; cold water.</p>
					<h4>Camping</h4>
					<p>In the higher reaches of the valley, alpine  tents with sleeping bags can be provided, while food can be arranged at local  homes in the villages.</p>

				<h3>Food &amp; Drinks</h3>
					<p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/img-spiti-food-drink.gif" align="right">Spiti's administrative capital, Kaza, offers a surprising array of cuisines, ranging from local Tibetan food, to typical North Indian dishes, Israeli food, and even wood-fired pizzas!</p>
					<p>In the higher reaches of Spiti, traditional  Tibetan food is more readily available, and typically consists of <em>momos</em> (dumplings) and <em>thukpa </em>(thick noodles in soup). The  extreme winter climate practically cuts off the valley from the rest of India,  making non-vegetarian food a predominant choice. In the summer months,  vegetarian options are easily available.</p>
					<h4>Drinks</h4>
					<p>Butter tea, a Tibetan delicacy, is often served  in the higher reaches of the village, and though it might not immediately  appease the palette, it must be tried at least once!</p>
					<p>Seabuckthorne is a highly nutritious wonder  berry grown in the Himalayas, and drinks made from it are a rare specialty.  Bottles of locally made Seabuckthorne crush can be bought at Spiti Ecosphere’s  office in Kaza.</p>
					<p>As with any mountain region, local alcoholic  drinks are home-brewed in the villages to keep warm in the winter. Chang and  Arakh, both made of barley, are the indigenous versions of beer and whiskey  respectively.</p>
					<p>Flavoured teas, including lemon, mint, ginger  &amp; honey, are served in all restaurants in Kaza, and a delight in Spiti’s  extreme weather conditions.</p>

				<div id="location" class="tabs_content_bgtop">
					<h3>Location</h3>
					<p>Spiti is located in the Trans-Himalayan belt of  Himachal Pradesh, and is accessible by road from Shimla &amp; Manali. Shimla  &amp; Manali can be reached from Delhi by air or road (bus or taxi). </p>
					<p>The distance between Shimla and Kaza (Spiti’s  administrative capital) is 420 kms, and typically takes 16-20 hours by bus or  jeep. This route is practically open throughout the year. The distance between Manali  and Kaza is 213 km, and typically takes 10-11 hours by bus or jeep. This route  is only open between late May and early October (depending on weather  conditions).</p>
					<p>While both the routes are very scenic, the journey  to Spiti up precarious mountain roads is not for the faint-hearted!</p>
					<h4>Best time to visit</h4>
					<p>The best time to visit the valley is between May  and October, when days are warm, nights are pleasantly cool, and snowfall is  rare.</p>
					<h4>Checklist</h4>
					<ul class="listing">

					<h3>Reviews</h3>
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;It was an amazing trip. I wanted my family to experience a different kind of holiday - that is totally different from the kind of lives they lead. I have travelled extensively in remote rural areas and wanted my family to experience this too! My family had a great time... Our [homestay] hosts were one of the most wonderful people we have met. Their simplicity and warmth bowled us over.&ldquo;  <strong> ~ <em>Ms Shobha Raghavan, travelled with her family in June 2013.</em></strong></p>
					<div class="sep"></div>
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;Spiti is an unforgettable trip. After about 7 days since return, the tan is now fading but the experience of the trip has left an indelible mark. I was immensely impressed by the opportunity to spending life up and close with villagers in Demul and Komic and that would probably be the highlight for me. The trek from Demul to Komic and to Dhanker lake are great reminders of what being physically fit means in high altitude.<br>
						<br>
						Ishita and team are doing a great job and took great care of us. The trip is an experience of lifetime.&ldquo;  <strong> ~ <em>Mayank, travelled solo on the Spiti Safari trip in June 2013.</em></strong></p>
					<div class="sep"></div>
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;I’m still relishing the memories of Spiti and the wonderful people I met on this trip. The Kinnaur &amp; Spiti jeep safari had been the best of the journeys I have undertaken till yet. I never expected the trip, especially the hotels &amp; homestays to be as good as they were. The rooms in all the hotels were very neat and clean, especially bathrooms, and all of them had amazing views. The best was in Kalpa and Dhankar. The homestays in Demul &amp; Komic too were beautiful. It was wonderful to put up with the locals of some of the remotest villages in Asia and experience their routine life. Chhering (our guide ) was par excellence. He was genuinely concerned about everyone on the trip and looked after each one of us personally. Everyone enjoyed his company and all the stories he told us about Spiti and its people. Driving in this part of Asia is one of the toughest things to do but Gatuk (our driver) was simply superb at it. A highly recommended journey for anyone who wants to try something different.&ldquo;  <strong> ~ <em>Mr Piyush Patni, travelled with friends on the Kinnaur Spiti Trip in June 2013.</em></strong></p>
					<div class="sep"></div>
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;I loved the homestays. It felt great to stay with the locals. My favourite hotel was in Dhankar. Amazing views and awesome staff. Special mention of our Spitian guide Chering .He was a really nice person who really cared about our welfare. Overall amazing trip.Travel was strenuous, so can suggest 2 days halt at some places. Would want to volunteer at Ecosphere in future. They do amazing work.&ldquo;  <strong> ~ <em>Ms Vandhana Mohanraj, travelled solo on the Kinnaur Spiti Trip in June 2013.</em></strong></p>
					<div class="sep"></div>
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;The trip was excellent. The guide named Cherring was very good and helpful. He was very genuine and caring. The car Innova and the driver named Gatok were also very good. The driver and the guide went out of their way and helped us for our needs. The scenery was pretty breathtaking. The people of Spiti were very kind and loving. They welcomed us with open hearts. The places to stay were pretty decent and clean.&ldquo;  <strong> ~ <em>Mr Ankit Agrawal, travelled with friends on the Kinnaur Spiti Trip in June 2013.</em></strong></p>

I thoroughly  enjoyed interacting with each one of them, their curiosity about the world, was something that I shall take away with me. :) Our  guide Tsering was also wonderful, his knowledge about the buddhist monasteries was  extremely helpful!&ldquo;<br>

					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;I had never heard of "Spiti" till I came across a beautiful snap on your website and from that moment on, I had decided that I am gonna go there! The location was amazing -- what blew me off is the onward and return journey (esp the return journey) -- it was so funny, I was sleepy but was keeping my eyes open so that I dont miss on a single amazing view! I especially loved the Kunzum pass :) The homestays were both really nice! It was the first of a kind experience for me and was a good experience -- we even learnt how to make Momos !! The Post office experience was lovely!! The thrill of posting from the highest post office, the lovely stamps, the hospitable postman -- they<br>
						even served us tea!! The post cards havent reached though. Not yet :P Overall -- I must say a lovely trip. The hotels selected, the locations, the guide. Looking forward to travelling with India Untravelled again :)&ldquo;  <strong> ~ <em>Ms Mansee Shah, works in Baroda, and travelled solo.</em></strong></p>

					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;I absolutely loved the Spiti trip! I had wonderful experiences meeting new people, exploring quaint villages and discovering the wonders of this beautiful country. I really enjoyed the homestays and eating local Spiti food. I also liked the fact that it was a small group, if it had been much larger we would have had a harder time moving about.&ldquo; <strong> ~ <em>Ms Sami Steer, exchange student in Hyderabad, and travelled solo.</em></strong></p>

				<h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
					<p>Spiti Ecosphere is a social enterprise based in  Spiti. Its travels offer a unique insight into the culture, nature, history,  ecology and legends of these valleys, while ensuring that your visits to these  pristine locales benefit their economy, conservation and development. All  emissions that are generated are calculated and offset through investments in  Ecosphere’s renewable energy initiatives in the region. You can hence be  assured that your trips will leave a zero carbon footprint in the Himalayas.</p>
					<p>All revenues generated by Spiti Ecosphere are ploughed back for the  economic, environmental and social development of the region. Below are some tips  to practice responsible travel while at Spiti:</p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as       possible.</li>
						<li>Do not leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. Carry batteries and other toxic       waste back to the cities where waste management is in place.</li>
						<li>What you wear has an impact – environmentally and culturally – dress ethically       and appropriately.</li>
						<li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
						<li>Carry a good water bottle. Pure water dug from the earth is available at the farm for re-filling your bottles. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
						<li>Local food is great. Try it as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for       modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
						<li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs, especially in       public places.</li>
						<li>Seek permission before photographing people, so their privacy is respected.</li>
						<li>Do  not pluck any medicinal plants &amp; flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife.</li>
					</ul>
