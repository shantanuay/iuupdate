					<p>Rajasthan is one of India's richest states with respect to culture, music, dance, food, and traditions. Whether you are traveling to the the golden triangle or looking to rejuvenate yourself over a weekend, Nirvana Organic Farm offers a quiet indulgence in the charms of rural Rajasthan without travelling too far from Jaipur city.</p>

					<p>Travel back in time as you live in traditional  thatched-roof cottages on the farm, and experience the warm hospitality of your  hosts - Maliram-ji, a farmer from the nearby village of Chomu, and his wife,  Manju-didi. You can reminisce about your childhood with popular village games  like <em>gulli-danda </em>&amp; <em>hop-scotch</em>, watch sunrise &amp;  sunset strolling amid the neighbouring fields of  mustard &amp; <em>jo</em>, participate in farm  activities, and watch artisans from the nearby village of Maheshpura  encapsulate the spirit of Rajasthan in their music and dance. Manju-didi’s food  is a pure delight, cooked on an open-air <em>chulha </em>with organic ingredients fresh off the farm.</p>

					<p>Accommodation at Nirvana Organic Farm is provided in comfortable &amp; spacious traditional thatched-roof cottages. While the walls of the cottages are made in concrete to prevent water from seeping in during the monsoon, they are coated with a mud finishing for temperature control. Each cottage has an attached western-style bathroom, covered with a fiber rooftop to recreate the experience of open rooftop bathing with the sunlight penetrating in, and yet keeping away falling leaves &amp; creepy-crawlies.</p>

					<p>The simplicity of the cottages lends a rural ambiance to the farm, while comfortable bedding, pillows and quilts make for a good night's sleep. Electricity is provided in the rooms, including bulbs and charging points, but is available only in the night. The veranda of each cottage overlooks the farm and its greens, and has locally crafted cane chairs to lounge in.</p>

					<h4>Food</h4>

					<p>Food is simple Rajasthani vegetarian fare, prepared by  Manju-didi on an open-air <em>chulha</em>, an  ancient mode of Indian cooking, now found only in rural parts of India.  Breakfast typically consists of <em>aloo  paranthas </em>served with <em>dahi</em>, while  lunch and dinner vary with the seasonality of the farm vegetables. <em>Dal-bati-churma </em><em>is a Rajasthani speciality</em>, consisting of a combination of lentils (dal), round hard bread famous  in the desert region of Rajasthan (bati), and a popular delicacy prepared with  ground wheat &amp; sugar (churma).</p>

					<p>As far as possible, the food is prepared with vegetables and herbs grown on the farm. The resident cows and goats provide milk, and spice levels can be moderated accordingly to your taste buds.</p>

					<p>Food is served on traditional banana leaves, and you  can choose to dine at the lounging area of the farm, in the verandah of your  cottage, or while sitting cross-legged on the floor of the <em>chaupal </em>(a large empty room) in traditional Rajasthani style.</p>

					<h4>Drinks</h4>

					<p>Delicious <em>Chai</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;is prepared in typical village style – milky and sweet – and served in mud cups  locally called <em>Kulars</em>. Lemon trees at the  farm bear fruit all year round, making both <em>Nimbu  Pani </em>(lemonade) and lemon tea refreshing to drink.</p>

					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;We had a very good experience at the farm, infact quite pleasing environment and very good hosts.&rdquo; <strong> ~ Nitin, travelled with his family in July 2013</strong></p>

					<div class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;We had a good time at the farm. I would like to share some pros and cons of our trip there:&rdquo;

						<div class="quoteTxt">Pros:</div>

						<ul class="listing">

							<li>Very peaceful place, allows you to unwind. Staff is very unobtrusive.</li>

							<li>Very nice natural accommodation in small thatched huts.<br>

							</li>

							<li>Exceptional food provided by Mrs. Maliram. We were served Dal-Bati and Churma which are local Rajasthani delicacies and it was very authentic and great! Food prices are very reasonable.<br>

							</li>

							<li>Place is brimming with many birds and assorted small mammals - nature watchers paradise.<br>

							</li>

						</ul>

						<div class="clearB"></div>

						<div class=" padT20 quoteTxt">Cons:</div>

						<ul  class="listing">

							<li>It was really hot 43 degrees C. There were very frequent power cuts, so the fan in the room was not working making it quite unbearable. It would be nice if the owners look at providing an invertor backup just to keep the fan running, or else resort to some natural cooling methods like khus blinds etc.</li>

							<li>The cab from Rajjas Travels charged us Rs 1390 and Rs 1150 respectively for our to and fro trips. They added the kilometers for reaching the airport for the pickup from their starting location adding the costs on top of the Rs 700 you had mentioned earlier. You should look for cheaper travel options to reach this place from Jaipur.

					<p>In 2004, Mr Arvind Modi bought a piece of barren farmland 22 km away from Jaipur. The neighbouring farming settlements were only growing cash crops on their fields for commercial reasons, and the ecology of the region was suffering due to a lack of trees that would grow and flower seasonally, but never leave the land barren. Mr Modi began to plant trees of lesva, drumsticks and bel, among others, and using organic farming techniques, revived the barren soil and managed to save the trees from the Rajasthan summer, when temperatures rise as high as 43 degrees Celsius.</p>

					<p>Changes in the weather were gradually felt, and today it is possible to lounge in a shaded area of the farm even in the summer, with the trees swaying away in the cool breeze. Nirvana Organic farm soon became a place where farmers from the nearby villages could learn about organic farming and traditional Indian agricultural practices</p>

					<p>Below are some tips to practice responsible travel while at Nirvana Organic Farm:</p>

					<ul class="listing">

						<li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as       possible.</li>

						<li>Do not leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. Carry batteries and other toxic       waste back to the cities where waste management is in place.</li>

						<li>What you wear has an impact – environmentally and culturally – dress ethically       and appropriately.</li>

						<li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>

						<li>Carry a good water bottle. Pure water dug from the earth is available at the farm for re-filling your bottles. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>

						<li>Local food is great. Try it as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>

						<li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs, especially in public places</li>

						<li>Seek permission before photographing people, so their privacy is respected.</li>

						<li>Do not pluck any medicinal plants &amp; flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife.</li>

					</ul>
