                            natural beauty we&rsquo;re surrounded by.</p>

                        <img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs_overview-Garhwal-himalaya.jpg" align="right">
                        <p>Deep in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, along a breathtaking stretch of the Himalayas, sits a beautiful little mountain village with a population of less than 30 people. Above, waterfalls of the pristine Asi Ganga river form
                            natural freshwater swimming pools (and even a Jacuzzi!) for a refreshing dip, and below, the river flows ferociously. At 5,000 feet, the village makes a good base to start treks to the lakes of Dodital and Gangotri-Yamnotri,
                            but an even better base to lose yourself in the tranquillity of the mountains and catch up on the things you never get time for in the cities.</p>
                        <p>A half hour drive from Uttarkashi, this homestay in the Garhwal Himalayas is nestled quietly at the edge of the village and the home of a young couple who quit their high-flying jobs in the cities to move back to the mountains
                            they love. They have lovingly handcrafted two brick huts with five rooms and three Swiss tents to host travellers and share their slice of mountain paradise. Such comfort so high up in the Himalayas is a real treat.</p>
                        <p>Indulge in Anil and Sree&rsquo;s warm hospitality, hearing tales of their adventurous lives in the mountains and their transition from city life. Stroll through the village to meet the friendly mountain folk, sample local and fusion
                            recipes made with local ingredients often found wild in the forest, hike to neighbouring villages that sit atop pretty terraced valleys, trek into the higher reaches of the mountains, and lay back on the &ldquo;stargazing rock&rdquo;
                            to spot shooting stars and constellations in a starry night sky. Most of all, savour the pristine beauty of the Garhwal Himalayas! </p>

                        <p>The homestay is one couple&rsquo;s effort to live in tune with nature, in the mighty and relatively undiscovered Garhwal Himalayas. Accommodation for travellers is offered in two aesthetically handcrafted huts, that together have
                            5 rooms. Each room is spacious and comfortably furnished with cushy mattresses, attached bathrooms and spectacular views of the mountains beyond. Three Swiss tents are erected for travellers looking for a more rustic and outdoor
                            stay, with modern bathrooms a short walk away. </p>
                        <p>The lounge area aka &ldquo;the hub&rdquo; is where travellers gather to meet each other and the hosts, pick a book from the in-house collection, chat and have tea. The hammocks, &ldquo;stargazing rock&rdquo; and open meadows offer
                            plenty of solitude to those seeking it. Meals are served in the dining hut. Your drinking water comes straight from the Asi Ganga through filters creatively fixed in the mountains; this is as pure as it gets!</p>
                        <p>You wake up to an orchestra of birds, can join your hosts in the kitchen to learn and share recipes, and practice yoga in the serene outdoors. A trap camera in strategic spots gives you a glimpse into the wildlife that crosses
                            by these mountains when you sleep!</p>
                        <p><em>Note: Reaching the  homestay requires 150 metres of walking up steps and a stone path in the  mountains. The staff will be happy to help with your luggage <strong style="font-style:normal; font-size: 21px;

                        <p>From traditional Garhwali food to fusion continental and north Indian recipes, you&rsquo;ll find the food at the homestay to be finger licking good! </p>
                        <p>Breakfast typically consists of Indian dishes like poha, paranthas, eggs cooked to order, fruits, bread and spreads. Homemade snacks and soups are served in the late evening at the hub. Lunch and dinner are a mix of seasonal veggies
                            and non-vegetarian dishes, sourced from local farmers in the village. Specialties include fern, which grows wild in the forest and takes a keen eye to identify and <em>rajma</em> (kidney beans) grown in the higher villages
                            of Garhwal.</p>

                        <p>You can plan to use Kuflon as a base for hiking and trekking, but leave space for your plans to change, because it&rsquo;s the kind of place where you just want to sit back, soak in the tranquillity of the mountains, indulge in
                            the warm hospitality and delicious food, and spend a do-nothing holiday!</p>
                        <p>Lay on a hammock and gaze at the mountains, spend time chatting with your hosts over tea, meet the village folk and learn about their lives, walk down to the ferociously flowing Ganga, hike up (10-15 minutes) to the freshwater
                            pools made by the Asi Ganga for a refreshing dip, and find inspiration to paint, draw, write and do the things you love to do but rarely get time for.</p>

                        <p> The village of Kuflon is quietly tucked away half an hour from the town of Uttarkashi. It is at a driving distance of 6-7 hours from Rishikesh and Mussoorie, through gorgeous landscapes and panoramic views of the terraced Himalayas
                            and the Asi Ganga. A semi-deluxe public bus plies the route daily to Uttarkashi, from where taxis are easily available to the village.</p>
                        <p>The nearest domestic airport is at Dehradun, and the nearest international airport is in Delhi.</p>
                        <h4>Best time to visit</h4>
                        <p>The months from March to June and September to November are the most pleasant, with sunny days and cool nights. The winter months from November to March are cold, but offer spectacular views of the snow-capped Himalayan peaks,
                            and sometimes snow in the village itself. </p>
                        <h4>Average temperatures:</h4>

                        <h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
                        <p>Anil and Shree left their jobs in the cities and moved to the mountains of Garhwal a few years ago. They strive to live in tune with nature and their pristine surroundings as much as possible. The huts are built using locally sourced
                            materials, and though furbished with all urban comforts, use natural airflow techniques to keep warm in the cold winters. Drinking water at the homestay is channeled naturally from the Ganga, with filters creatively installed
                            in the mountain paths. </p>
                        <p>The host family have been tracking weather data in these mountains to track changes in weather patterns over the years. Trap cameras are installed at strategic locations to track local wildlife. All staff is employed from the surrounding
                            villages, and local guides are used for hiking / trekking. Wastage is minimized as much as possible; biodegradable waste is used to make compost for vegetables and herbs organically grown on the land, while non-biodegradable
                            waste is recycled through the local rag pickers. </p>
                        <p>Below are some tips to travel responsibly while in Kuflon:</p>
                        <ul class="listing">
                            <li>Carry a good water bottle. Filtered water is available at the house for refilling your bottle. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
                            <li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as possible.</li>
                            <li>Do not litter or leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. Carry it to the cities where better waste management systems are in place.</li>
                            <li>What you wear has an impact. Dress appropriately, especially when you walk into the villages.</li>
                            <li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
                            <li>Local food is great. Try it as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
                            <li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs, especially in public places.</li>
                            <li>Seek permission before photographing people, so as to respect their privacy.</li>
                            <li>Do not pluck any plants and flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife. </li>
                        </ul>
