			<h3>Trip Overview</h3>
			<p>Far  from the beaches and reveling crowds of Goa, India Untravelled invites you for  a slice of a real Goan paradise. You stay with three generations of a Goan  family in their quaint ancestral Goan-Portuguese home, discover virgin  backwaters on a kayak and speedboat, travel back in time to traditional  bakeries and old Portuguese homes, and experience the <em>susagade</em> way of life in the charming, sleepy village of Aldona.</p>
			<p>We  recommend that you shed your pre-conceived notions of Goa on this trail. Mingle  with your laid-back neighbors as they catch up on the village gossip, treat  your taste buds to the delights of home-cooked Goan cuisine, let your hosts  regale you with stories of the Portuguese times gone by, feel liberated as you  ride a bicycle or motorbike through the lush interiors of North Goa, discover  ancient rock-cut caves, breathtaking waterfalls and pristine lakes, go street  shopping at the local market, participate in traditional festivals and family  gatherings… and live like a Goan for a few days!</p>

			<p><strong>Goan breads at a  traditional bakery</strong>:  You&rsquo;ll be one of the lucky few to take in the tempting aromas of freshly baked  Goan bread, as it is taken out hot from the life-sized earthen oven, the only  traditional one remaining in these parts.

			<h3>Brief Itinerary</h3>
			<p>The Goa Away from The Beaches trail is perfect for those who want to ditch the beaches and crowds of Goa, experience life as a local and discover Goa’s best kept secrets. This trail can be customized based on your travel days and interests. </p>
			<p><strong>Days 1: Meet  the family. Explore Aldona on mountain bikes</strong></p>
			<p>The <em>Goa Away from the Beaches </em>experience can start at Panjim Airport, which is  connected to the rest of India by domestic flight connections. Or at the Thivim  station in North Goa. A pickup can be organized if required, or you can hop  into a local bus or taxi.</p>
			<p>Your homestay with the Amaral family is located in the sleepy little  village of Aldona, deep in the interiors of North Goa. This Goan-Portuguese  house is atleast 500 years old, though the exact date of its construction  remains unknown. You stay in one of two private rooms in the outhouse cottage,  with a common verandah, surrounded by the wilderness of trees and chirping  birds, a few meters from the family home.</p>
			<p>Spend time getting to know your hosts Roberto and Raquel, who have grown  up in these parts, and are full of fascinating stories about life in Goa and  how it has changed since the hippie era. Read, write, paint, draw, do the  things you love, on the open terrace or lying on a hammock amid the greenery.</p>
			<p>Cycle around Aldona on the in-house mountain bikes, or walk along the  gentle terrain. Mingle with neighbors lounging outside their homes and locals  working in their rice paddies. Grab a bite at the market, sneak a peek at the  village church, walk through the cemetery, join locals fishing in the  backwaters, and enjoy the tranquility far from the popular notions of Goa! </p>
			<p><strong>Day 2: Day trip:  Arvalem waterfalls, rock-cut caves, Mayem Lake <u>OR</u> to Mapusa Market</strong></p>
			<p>Take a day trip to the fascinating Arvalem rock-cut  caves, believed to be Asia&rsquo;s oldest, yet completely off the tourist radar. Wade  into the stunning high Arvalem waterfall. Row a paddleboat into the peaceful  Mayem Lake. Or choose to visit the favorite street market of North Goans in the  town of Mapusa, for a day of bargain hunting!</p>
			<p>In the late afternoon, let your hosts give you an intimate glimpse into  the village they call home. Stop by at the village church and cemetery, the Aldona  fort, abandoned Portuguese homes, ancient bridges and swanky new ones, and end  off at the region&rsquo;s last remaining traditional bakery to watch (and devours)  fresh breads being baked in a life-size earthen oven. The little joys of life  in Goa!</p>
			<p><strong>Days 3: Kayak in the backwaters.Guided village trip</strong></p>
			<p>Just when  you think Goa can&rsquo;t surprise you any more, you are lowered onto your kayak and  into a world that few are lucky enough to discover. Unlike the backwaters  of Kerala, you&rsquo;ll find no houseboats here – just you and an endless stretch of  serenity. Paddle your way into small coves, navigate mangroves, discover little  hamlets on the shores, spot birds and wildlife, go under the bridge to the  junction of the backwaters with the river, and find yourself rowing towards a  perfect Goan sunset.</p>
			<p><strong>Day 4: Optional trips</strong></p>
			<p>The <em>Goa Away from the Beaches </em>has been  designed for maximum relaxation, with some unique discoveries for just the  right balance.</p>
			<p>If  you feel like you want to pack in more, your options are aplenty:</p>
			<p>Join your host Roberto for the trip of a lifetime: zooming on a  speedboat through the uncharted backwaters of Goa! On this 1.5-hour trip, you  take in a glimpse of secluded villages, intricate mangroves, pristine  wilderness, eagles and kingfishers flying past, peacocks perched on trees, and  even an Indian Mugger Crocodile if you&rsquo;re lucky. Between October and March, you  can choose to speedboat into the Arabian Sea to scout for dolphins, who swim  through the these waters in winter. We time and plan the trip such that we are  able to ditch most other charters heading to see the dolphins.</p>
			<p>Go  island hopping on a ferry. Rent a bike or car and drive through the less  travelled river route via Pomburpa. Sample Goan dishes and urakh (feni&rsquo;s lesser  known cousin) at small family-run Goan eateries. Gamble the night away at the  floating casino. Go for a night of music and dancing, Goan style. Feel the  state of mind that is Goa.</p>
			<p>On  the last day of your trip (day 5), when you catch your flight or train home,  you&rsquo;ll be carrying a little bit of Goa in you.</p>

		<h3>Location:</h3>


			
			<h4 class="mrgT15">Best time to visit</h4>
			<p>If you like the rains, the monsoon season from July to September is delightful in Goa, with lush interiors, fewer crowds, and an intimate Goan community feel. Days are hot and nights cool in the winter and spring months from October to April. The summer months of May and June are warm and humid.</p>
			<h4 class="mrgT15">Fitness</h4>
			<p>This  trail is apt for people of all age groups and fitness levels, who want to  interact with locals, get an intimate peak into the Goan way of life, discover  the state&rsquo;s lesser known secrets, and flex their cycling and kayaking muscles  (though you don&rsquo;t have to if you don&rsquo;t want to)!</p>
			<h4 class="mrgT15">What to pack</h4>
			<p>Weather  in tropical Goa is mostly hot and humid. Carry light, cool summer clothes,  flip-flops, sunhat, sunscreen, essential medicines, and binoculars for bird  watching, camera to capture some unforgettable moments, and anything else good  for tropical weather. Goa is laid back and less conservative than the rest of  India, even in its rural villages, so feel free to wear dresses and shorts! Don&rsquo;t  forget a good water bottle so you can refill fresh well water at your homestay  instead of buying plastic mineral water bottles. If you&rsquo;re travelling in the  rains, carry an umbrella and poncho, and good mosquito repellant!</p>

			<h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
			<p class="mrgT25"><strong>How this trip makes a difference:</strong></p>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<ul class="listing">
				<li>Over the years, the Amaral family has worked hard to preserve their  Goan-Portuguese heritage and culture, and share it with travellers. Roberto and  Raquel aim to re-introduce guests to the culture, history, charm, and lifestyle  of Goa, which is slowly being eroded by mass tourism within the state.</li>
				<li>The current generation&rsquo;s restoration work aims at restoring the original  heritage, architecture and old-world charm of their house.</li>
				<li>Solar geysers are used to heat water, and refurbished antique furniture  is used in the guest rooms.</li>
				<li>A concentrated effort is made to preserve the wilderness around, and  grow or source organic vegetables, fruits and ingredients.</li>
				<li>The family actively participates in village affairs, and tries to effect  better environment and waste management.</li>
				<li>The  village trip aims to support the efforts of the local baker, who has continued  to bake breads in the region&rsquo;s last remaining traditional earthen oven, for  over 50 years.</li>
				<li>The  trail aims to introduce travellers to lesser known sites and attractions in Goa  to help preserve its ancient heritage and pristine natural beauty.</li>
				<li>The  revenues generated from this trip are reinvested to sustain efforts in heritage  conversation, as well as to further the cause of responsible travel in India.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<p class="mrgT25"><strong>How you can make a difference on this trip:</strong></p>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<ul class="listing">
				<li>Take  the time to interact with your hosts and think of yourself as a guest at a  family home. Please don&rsquo;t expect room service!</li>
				<li>Carry  a good water bottle and ask to refill filtered drinking water at your  accommodation. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
				<li>Pack  your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as  possible.</li>
				<li>Do  not leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. Carry batteries and other toxic  waste back to the cities where waste management is in place.</li>
				<li>Respect  the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
				<li>Try  local food as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for modifications  in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
				<li>Avoid  excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs, especially in public  places.</li>
				<li>Seek  permission before photographing people, so their privacy is respected.</li>
				<li>Do  not pluck any medicinal plants &amp; flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife. </li>
