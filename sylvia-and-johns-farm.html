                        <p class=" quoteTxt">&ldquo;Our’s is a rather unique homestay nestled in thick evergreen forest with abundant waterfalls and wildlife. By virtue of its very remote location and lack of supplied electricity we operate our little place with the use of
                            very simple solar panels and batteries. It is a place to digitally detox with no cell phones signals, where parents can breathe a sigh of relief that their children are playing with sticks, clay and water rather than Ipads.
                            If you love to get away from humanity and trek in uninhabited jungles and sit around bonfires on chilly nights, then you will feel at home.&rdquo;</p>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/sylvia-and-johns-farm-overview.png" align="right" alt="Offbeat stays in goa, Offbeat places to visit in goa, camping in goa, trekking in goa, jungle stay in goa, stay in dedhsagar, homestays in dudhsagar, farmstays in dudhsagar, waterfalls in goa">                            The Farmstay is one of the lesser known secrets of Goa. It is situated in the Western Ghats, on the border of Goa and Karnataka, near Castle Rock just over the border from Goa in Karnataka. John and Sylvia took ownership of
                            it in 2003 and built a house, which took a long time since there was no road to the place and a very rough track for 10 kilometers was the only approach. Much later on, when prompted by a friend who ran motorcycle adventure
                            tours, the idea of taking in visitors came to being. The area around is as remote as it gets in Peninsular India. There are very few people and very few villages. Uninhabited tracks connecting up the villages provide good areas
                            to do treks. There are some 25 villages with between 3 and 25 houses in an area of nearly 1500 sq/km and it has now been taken into the buffer zone of the Dandeli and Anshi Tiger reserve.</p>
                        <p>Sylvia is a potter and has a studio at the farm itself. John on the other hand is an adventure sports enthusiast and has been a pioneer in white water rafting. Together they have worked hard and brought this farm to life.</p>
                        <p>The farm uses solar energy for lighting, a waterfall for plentiful year round water supply, and firewood from the forest for cooking. Though not self-sufficient plenty of the food from the garden finds itself onto your table.</p>
                        <p>The Farming here is the same as it has been on small farms in these areas for hundreds of years- mainly rice-growing, some fruit trees and of course our vegetables in the kitchen garden.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/sylvia-and-johns-farm-activities.png" align="right" alt="Trek to Dudhsagar falls">The Wilderness around is a natural adventure land for nature lovers. There are many hidden waterfalls which we visit,
                            one of which is at a stone's throw from the property, and a better swimming pool one cannot find. Some of the activities that one could indulge in while at the farm are:</p>
                        <ul class="listing">
                            <li>Wildlife sightings - Wildlife is plentiful, although sightings are rare due to the thickness of the forest. But signs of Indian Gaur (locally known as Bison) and the largest bovine on earth are common, and other animals like
                                Sambar Deer, Sloth Bear, Porcupine, Ant Eaters and, of course, Leopards are always around.</li>
                            <li>Trekking- Trekking here is ideal and the best way to enjoy the area. The mixed forest and African Savannah like grasslands within close range of the property make short treks very easy.</li>
                            <li>Birdwatching - Many bird watchers also come to see species like the Asian Fairy Bluebird, Rufous Babbler, Great Indian Hornbill, White-bellied Blue Flycatcher, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Grey Jungle Fowl and Flame-throated Bulbul
                                and many more, but sightings may be difficult due to the density of the forest.</li>
                            <li>Trek to Dudhsagar falls – Though closed this year, A new canopy walk and footpath will be open soon.</li>
                            <li>Workshops: During the season we have a range of workshops for kids, families, adults, potters, clay lovers, cob building enthusiasts, and bird watchers. There is a new pottery studio with a wood-fired kiln taking shape. People
                                are welcome to try their hand at pottery, but classes are available only on request.</li>

                        <h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
                        <p>Sylvia and John have taken great efforts to merge the farm with the rest of the region and the wilderness. The farm is self-sufficient for its utilities and has no electricity/ water/ gas connection to its name. It uses solar energy
                            for lighting, a waterfall for plentiful year round water supply, and firewood from the forest for cooking. Perhaps this is how we were meant to live, one with nature.</p>
                        <p>The Farming here is the same as it has been on small farms in these areas for hundreds of years- mainly rice-growing, some fruit trees and of course some vegetables in the kitchen garden.</p>
                        <p>The waste collected at the farm is segregated. Organic material is composted and the metal & glass is transferred to Mapusa for recycling. Plastic is reused as much as possible. Paper is used to start the numerous fires we have
                            in the evenings for bonfire & ovens.</p>
