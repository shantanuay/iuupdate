			<h3>Brief Itinerary</h3>
				<p>The <em>Secrets of the Kumaon Himalayas </em>trail  allows you to get away from the chaos and crowds of India, and experience the  simple beauty of life in the mountains. This trail can be customized based on  your travel days and interests.</p>
				<p><strong>Day 1, 2 &amp; 3: Homestay in a 19<sup>th</sup> century colonial bungalow in Bhimtal</strong><br>
					The <em>Secrets of the Kumaon Himalayas</em> experience can start in Delhi, which offers several international and domestic flight connections. From Delhi, you can take the Shatabdi train to Kathgodam, the nearest railway station, and travel 1.5 hours further by car to your first homestay in the lake district of Kumaon.</p>
				<p>Once you drive past the initial concrete construction of Nainital&rsquo;s lesser-known neighbor, the Himalayas unveil a quaint hill station lined by charming mountain homes, surrounded by lush forests, and home to fascinating wildlife and local legends.</p>
				<p>Your first homestay – <a href="smetaceks-colonial-homestay-bhimtal.html">Smetaceks&rsquo; Colonial Homestay</a> – is located in the  tranquil hills of Bhimtal, where you stay with an Anglo-Indian family, in a  charming 19th century colonial bungalow.</p>
				<p>Spend your time in Bhimtal discovering the little treasures of the  Himalayas. Partake of the indulgent hospitality of your host family, and travel  through time to unearth their fascinating family history. Sample delicious  home-cooked food prepared with locally grown ingredients, using Anglo recipes  that have stood the test of time. Read, write, paint, draw, do the things you  love, in the cozy outdoor and indoor hideouts around the house, with the mighty  Himalayas forming an inspiring backdrop.</p>
				<p>Explore the surrounding forests, lush farms, and quaint villages on  foot. Find your way to the pristine lakes of Sattal for a dip in the warm  afternoon sun. Pick tea at the Orange Pekoe Tea Bushes planted by the British  in the 1850s. Walk to the pretty English church of Bhimtal. &nbsp;Spread out  your picnic lunch by the lakes, or warm yourself over a bonfire dinner under  the stars. Stroll along picturesque villages in the terraced valleys and stop by for lunch in a village home. Let the Smetacek boys take you on secret trails in these mountains  they call home. And begin your love affair with the majestic Himalayas of  Kumaon.</p>
				<p><strong>Days 4 &amp; 5: Village stay near Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary</strong><br>
					After acquainting yourself with life in the lower Kumaon Himalayas,  drive up (~3 hours) through old forests of oak, pine and rhododendron, into the  heart of rural Kumaon, where your next homestay sits in the picturesque country  village of Shaukiyathal.</p>
				<p>Your homestay in Shaukiyathal is in a typical mountain home, quaint and  colorful, with small windows peeking out at stunning views of the mighty  Himalayas. The western bathroom and bathing areas are created separately to  cater to urban comforts.</p>
				<p>Spend your time in Shaukiyathal rejuvenating in the lap of the  mountains, snow-capped in the winter months from October to March. Immerse in  the traditional mountain hospitality and culture of Kumaon. Get to know your  host village family, who have called this region home for many generations.  Sample the sumptuous cuisine of Kumaon, prepared with organic home-grown  ingredients.</p>
				<p>On a guided walk through the village, witness centuries-old temple and  village architecture, walk through forests of cedar and pine, stroll along  picturesque terraced valleys and mountain farms, and learn about life in this  relatively remote region. Take a half-day trip to the Binsar Wildlife  Sanctuary, and hike along the habitat of its illusive animal and bird life, to  Zero Point, for an unforgettable view of snow-capped Himalayan peaks (dependent on the  weather and the mist).</p>
				<p><strong>Day 6, 7 &amp; 8: Homestay at The Dak Bungalow in Peora</strong></p>
				<p>Retrace the footsteps of the Raj to the scenic hamlet of Peora, a 2-3  hour drive from Shaukiyathal. In 1905, the British built here a magnificent  inspection bungalow on what was then the silk route on the  Kathgodam-Almora-Bageshwar bridle road. A hundred years later, Pradeep and  Shubha leased out the dilapidated bungalow from the government, and restored it  – <a href="dak-bungalow-Peora.html">The Dak Bungalow at Peora</a> – to its original colonial glory.</p>
				<p>This is your last homestay on this trail, in the time warp of the lost  heritage of the Himalayas – old fireplaces, wooden ceilings and grand  verandahs, coupled with homely hospitality and panoramic Himalayan views.  Lounge in the outdoors with a book, indulge in lively conversations with your  hosts, stop at the village dhaba for a quintessential plate of hot Maggi, or  set out on a walk through the surrounding forest to the terraced valleys and  village homes of Peora below.</p>
				 
				<p> Take a day trip or  trek through the mountains to the ancient temple towns of Almora and  Mukteshwar. On cold winter nights, warm yourself by the heat of the old fireplace  in your cozy room.</p>

  <p class=" quoteTxt">&ldquo; Let me begin by thanking you and the team at india untravelled for organizing the trip and and arranging the logistics . You guys had taken care of all aspects of the trip and it made our trip ever more enjoyable . As far as our experiences  at the home stays are concerned , we had a wonderful experience<br><br>We enjoyed our stay at the Dak Bungalow . Pradeep and Shobha made us feel at home and we enjoyed their hospitality . The food was good and we especially liked their home made jams . Though we didn't get to see the Nandadevi range due to the weather , the view of the valley from Dak bungalow was spectacular . Binsar trip was a disappointment though . It takes a couple of hours to reach Binsar from Peora and there's not much to see around . You guys could include an alternative to it if possible.<br><br>Bhimtal stay was amazing too . Paddy is an excellent hostess and she took care of all our needs .The trek to Panna tal and sattal was the highlight of our trip . Its was nice to trek along an unspoiled route and lakes are really clean and less crowded.<br><br>Overall, we had a nice trip .  We look forward to doing more trips through india untravelled and will definitely recommend it to others.&rdquo;<br>

            <p class=" quoteTxt">&ldquo;We really enjoyed our stay at all the three homestays and we met quiet a few interesting people. All the three homestays were different in their own way and we enjoyed with all the hosts. We will surely recommend the kumaon trail to people who enjoy being surrounded by nature.<br>		<br>				Thank you :)&rdquo;<br>

                   <div class="sep"></div>
              <p class=" quoteTxt">&ldquo;A trip to the Kumaon Highlands is an easy, hassle-free and rewarding jaunt from Delhi that can be done comfortably in under a week. The homestay - Smatacek's Colonial Homestay and Dak Bungalow - are the highlights of the experience, with fascinating conversations over delicious meals. The homestays are surrounded by beautiful woodlands and forests, perfect for people who love nature and walking. Uttarakhand is an under-appreciated area, all the better for those who care to go, as it isn't overrun with tourists!&rdquo;<br><br>
                    I had the pleasure of meeting one old gentleman Mathpal Singh who runs a small museum outside of Bhimtal. He runs a museum of hundreds of his own archaeological and artistic works - remarkable!<br><br>
                    
                    Just wanted to send my belated thanks to India Untravelled once again. I should be taking 3 or 4 trips to India next year and look forward to another India Untravelled itinerary.<br>
					<strong> ~ Manda Foo, travelled Solo to Kumaon in July 2015</strong></p>
                      <div class="sep"></div>
				<p class="quoteTxt">&ldquo;We did indeed enjoy our time in India. The organisation worked perfectly and we found each place interesting and fun.  Our hosts made us very welcome, fed us extremely well and gave good advice on the activities we might enjoy. We, too enjoyed their company.<br>
					<br>
					Our Kuamon hosts were brilliant, though the mattress at Peora was a little hard for our western bodies.  Shubha and Pradeep responded promptly and gave us another mattress. Thoroughly enjoyed our time there with many walks through villages and also some shopping with Pradeep.  The food here was delicious.<br>
					<br>
					There was also no hot water provided at Deora and we assumed there was none available.  However when asked, suggested by the folks at Binsar, it was willingly provided. A most interesting and unique stay. We did feel it was a long way to Binsar to arrive at the wrong time of the day to see any wildlife though the walk was great as was the lunch. Maybe the original village is closer. Again thoroughly enjoyed the food.<br>
					<br>
					Everything about our Bhimtal stay was wonderful.  Paddy is such an interesting person and a terrific host.  Good conversation, reading, lots of walking and some swimming kept us busy but relaxed. <br>
					<br>
					The food everywhere was fresh and yummy and we had not a hint of tummy trouble. <br>
					<br>
					Overall our trip surpassed expectations and we hope to explore more of India, with your help, in the future.  We have already recommended you to our friends.&rdquo;<br>

				<p class=" quoteTxt">&ldquo;I had a great experience with the Kumaon Trail.<br>
					I absolutely loved my stay at Bhimtal. Paddy and her family is a wonderful host. I felt that I am staying with my extended family! Paddy served me with absolute love and affection. The food here was to die for. Though I did not go for a village walk and the BBQ dinner could not be arranged because of bad weather, I loved my hiking spree across the lakes and paddy fields of the town. The homestay was absolutely safe for solo travelers and the facilities are great too. The house has an old world charm and the location is very quaint and peaceful. I would absolutely recommend this place to my family and friends and would love to visit again too. <br>
					<br>
					After the initial hiccups at the village, my later stay at the homestay was delightful. The highlight of the stay was the location where the house is situated. The trip to Binsar was good, however due to bad weather I could not explore the forest much. The village walk was fun and I met a lot of village families. Just a suggestion - the place is actually run by a family, which was not around because of ill health of one of their family members. Would be good if in future you can inform the visitor beforehand about such situations as this would not lead to any apprehensions, as the house is at a pretty remote location and might raise doubts for someone who is visiting the first time.&rdquo;<br>
					<br>
					I loved my experience with Roads Untraveled. Being a solo woman traveler, I was a little apprehensive about staying at a homestay initially, but I must say that it was an absolute delight and would love to travel through you again!						&rdquo;<br>

				<div class="clearfix"></div>
				<ul class="listing">
					<li>The  Bhimtal and Peora accommodations on this trail are heritage properties, which  have been lovingly restored by the owners with locally sourced materials,  avoiding the carbon footprint of building from scratch.</li>
					<li>The  village homestay in Shaukiyathal is set up and run by a local village family,  in partnership with a local organization that attempts to bring community-based  tourism to their postcard village and augment unsteady farming incomes.</li>
					<li>All  accommodations on this trail are homestays, giving you a chance to interact  closely with the hosts and understand life (and how life has changed) in the  region.</li>
					<li>The  homestays on this trail are either run by or employ staff from the local  village communities to look after travellers, creating an alternate source of  income through tourism.</li>
					<li>Host  families on this trail are environmentally committed, with measures like  organic farming, volunteering, and restoration and conservation efforts in the  region.</li>
					<li>All  food provided in the homestays is freshly prepared in the host kitchen, using  locally grown and locally sourced ingredients.</li>
					<li>The  revenues generated from this trip are reinvested in the preservation of the  heritage properties and to support community-tourism, as well as to further the  cause of responsible travel in India.</li>

				<p class="mrgT25"><strong>How you can make a difference on this trip:</strong></p>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
				<ul class="listing">
					<li>While staying in the homestays, take the time to interact with your  hosts and think of yourself as a guest at a family home. Please don&rsquo;t expect  room service!</li>

					<li>Do not pluck any medicinal plants & flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife. </li>
