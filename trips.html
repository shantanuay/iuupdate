Rinchen Zangpo (957 – 1055 AD), also called Mahaguru, was an 11th century ruler and scholar in western Tibet. During his era, he initiated 108 temples inviting artisans from Kashmir who brought with them their unique style of art and painting. Thus, came into existence the most celebrated, and undoubtedly the most beautiful monasteries of Ladakh; The Alchi monastery, Mangyu monastery and Sumda-Chun monastery. Take this pilgrimage tour and explore the rich history of Ladakh’s kingdom. Stay at our beautiful village homestays, powered by solar energy, and experience local life of two beautiful villages of Ladakh. Also visit the high altitude Pangong-Tso Lake.</p>

                                        <p>Artisans of Ladakh are experts of making copper artifacts since hundreds of years. Sadly, this art is fading away and is now left limited to a few remote pockets in Ladakh. Through this tour we want to revive this dying art and also help in improving the livelihood of the villagers.
                                        <br>
                                        We will take you to the last remaining four Himalayan villages where this art is still practiced. Try this art with your own hands as the artisans teach you this skill. Take back a memorable souvenir for yourself.

                                            <strong> Costs</strong>: INR 41000 per person </p>
                                        <p>At an average altitude of 14,600 meters above sea level, the Changthang plateau is one of the least populated areas of the world. The vast is home to the Changpa nomads who live all year through in these harsh conditions. Near the lakes are grasslands which bloom in summers. The nomads migrate from their villages to these pastures with their livestock of Yaks, Sheep and Pashmina goats.
                                        <br>
                                        Mahé is one such nomadic village of Ladakh which offers an enriching experience of nomadic lifestyle. The village was solar electrified by our partner's initiative in Oct 2016 and it’s a unique village held mostly by women. These women majorly do labor work but they also know Carpet weaving which is common in Changthang. Off late the weaving is not being practiced a lot due to lack of market. The community face lot of other issues as well owing to climate change and cultural loss due to rampant urban migration.
                                        <br>
                                        Through homestay based tourism in Mahé we are engaging tourists to experience the nomadic culture, aiming alongside to improve the lives of this community. The region has breathtaking views, some unexplored lakes and endemic wildlife.</p>

                                        <p class="fixwidth">&quot;I had a wonderful time at Ladakh.<br> I cannot imagine a more beautiful place than Urbis. The trek was through valley of flowers and the homestay there was with such a lovely, warm hearted family. They took
                                            good care of every little detail and treated me like family :) Hospitality at it's best!<br> Travel to Pangong Tso was an experience not describable in words. The homestay was right next to the lake which was
                                            good.
                                            <br> Last but not the least, enjoyed local food experience. I am definitely going there again. Thanks a lot for helping me plan this much needed break.&quot;</p>

                                        <p class="fixwidth">&quot;It was a wonderful trip. Made lot of new friends. Guide and driver was excellent. Home stay was good too. Speechless about the beauty of the place.I can't think of anything that can improve except some more
                                            orientation on compost toilet would help. Or may be alternate toilet arrangements.
                                            <br> Thank you so much for such a wonderful trip. &quot;</p>

                                        <p class="fixwidth">&quot;The holiday in Spiti was one of the best, as it was firstly offbeat and it also gave me a good insight on the lives of the locals. Responsible travel and carbon neutrality is what attracted me to this kind
                                            of a holiday. The arrangements were very well done and our guides and drivers ensured we were taken care of. It was great to meet Ishita at Kaza and understand the good work she and her team are doing in Spiti.
                                            Loved the hospitality and warmth of our hosts at our homestays / guest houses and the people of Spiti overall. My favourite memories are Tabo, Komic and Langza. We should have a homestay at Langza instead of
                                            Demul. Langza's beauty was just too much for words. Would like to travel like this to other places as well in the future :)
                                            <br> Thanks for all the arrangements and coordination. &quot;</p>

                                        <p class="fixwidth">&quot;I&rsquo;m still relishing the memories of Spiti and the wonderful people I met on this trip. The Kinnaur &amp; Spiti jeep safari had been the best of the journeys I have undertaken till yet. I never expected
                                            the trip, especially the hotels &amp; homestays to be as good as they were. The rooms in all the hotels were very neat and clean, especially bathrooms, and all of them had amazing views. The best was in Kalpa
                                            and Dhankar. The homestays in Demul &amp; Komic too were beautiful. It was wonderful to put up with the locals of some of the remotest villages in Asia and experience their routine life. Chhering (our guide
                                            ) was par excellence. He was genuinely concerned about everyone on the trip and looked after&nbsp;each one of us personally. Everyone enjoyed his company and all the stories he told us about Spiti and its people.
                                            Driving in this part of Asia is one of the toughest things to do but Gatuk (our driver) was simply superb at it. A highly recommended journey for anyone who wants to try something different.&quot;</p>

                                            local Spiti food. I also liked the fact that it was a small group, if it had been much larger we would have had a harder time moving about and fitting in the jeep.&quot;</p>

                                            the Buddhist monasteries was extremely helpful!&quot;</p>

                                            the Kunzum pass :)&nbsp;The homestays were both really nice! It&nbsp;was the first of a kind experience for me and was a good experience&nbsp;-- we even learnt how to&nbsp;make Momos.&nbsp;The Post office experience
                                            was lovely! The thrill of posting from the&nbsp;highest post office, the lovely stamps, the hospitable postman – they even served us tea.&nbsp;The post cards haven&rsquo;t reached though. Not yet. Overall --
                                            I must say a lovely trip. The hotels selected, the&nbsp;locations, the guide.&nbsp;Looking forward to travelling with India Untravelled again :)&quot;</p>
