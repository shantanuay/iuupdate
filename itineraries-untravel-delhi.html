		<h3>Trip Overview</h3>
			<p>India Untravelled invites you on a most  exclusive discovery of India&rsquo;s capital city, Delhi. 5,000 years of history are  waiting to be unearthed, and mouth-watering food is everywhere; this is the  part you probably know. But did you know that the city also houses an extremely  talented village of potters? And clusters of mountain lakes  whose tranquility can  easily be mistaken for mighty Himalayan lakes? And that the Yamuna can be  witnessed at the cleanest right here in Delhi?</p>
			<p>Live with a local family at a homestay in South  Delhi, with comfortable air-conditioned rooms, attached bathrooms, and  (sometimes necessary) comforts such as free Wifi and satellite TV J From this base, explore the city for 4 days,  seeing it as you would never have otherwise. Leave behind your pre-conceived notions of  Delhi, and we are sure that the hidden gems in the city will impress you.</p>

			<h3>Brief Itinerary</h3>
			<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
			<p>Take it slow  on your first day, and give yourself time to adapt to the chaos and contrasts  of the city. Walk up to your terrace for a view of the Qutab Minar, lounge with  fellow travellers in the common dining area, and pamper your taste buds with  delicious home-cooked Indian meals. You can use the day to go visit places in  Delhi you&rsquo;ve heard about and always wanted to see, or set out on an unplanned  mini excursion on the Delhi Metro, which connects most parts of the city.</p>
			<p><strong>Day  2</strong></p>
			<p>After a leisurely mid-morning breakfast, set out  on your first guided trip. Visit homes in a pottery village located on the  outskirts of Delhi to see local potters spin magic on their wheel – from  miniature collectibles to life-size figurines – and let their talent amaze you.  Learn about their life and culture, and the basics of pottery. Try your hand at  the wheel, and make yourself your own Delhi souvenir to take home! Spend the  afternoon and evening on your own, exploring the walled city of Old Delhi or  soaking in the colonial charm of Lutyen&rsquo;s Delhi.</p>
			<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
			<p>In the evening, your third guided trip will find you travelling by <em>vikram </em>(bigger, shared version of the tuk-tuk)  to a village on the outskirts of Delhi. Hike in the Aravalli hills to a cluster  of five pristine mountain lakes, undoubtedly one of Delhi&rsquo;s best kept secrets!</p>
			<p><strong>Day 4</strong></p>
			<p>On your last day in Delhi,  depending on the time of your departure/further plans, you could shop in one of  the city&rsquo;s many street markets, go café hopping at Delhi&rsquo;s urban villages, or unearth  more of Delhi&rsquo;s history at its UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Rest assured there  will be much left to discover, and many reasons to come back!</p>
			<p><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong><br>
				Visit Little Tibet, a settlement of 350 Tibetan families, in North Delhi, on your second guided trip. Stroll along its narrow by-lanes to meet craftsmen stitching <em>thangkas</em>, goldsmiths making Tibetan jewellery, and small shops selling traditional Tibetan souvenirs; it's a whole other world other there! Sample some Tibetan momos or <em>thukpa </em>at the end of your tour.</p>

			<h3>Reviews</h3>
			<p>&quot;It would be very cliche If I say the Delhi trip was awesome! <br>
				<br>
				<strong>The stay:</strong><br>
				Thanks a lot for introducing the home stay! Fantastic people with great hospitality. Sanjeev - O what a spirit he has! We did not have a dull moment thru out our stay there!  And, the Dadi ma is really an inspiration to us. Breakfasts times with Dadima  and aroma of aloo paratha are still rewinding in our memories.<br>
				<br>
				They really surprised us  On my daughter's Birthday!!  On that day, we were leaving to Agra early morning. And, by 5 O clock, Sanjeev knocked our room door and wished my daughter with cake! My daughter is super thrilled and we too!<br>
				<br>
				There was a Birthday card signed by whole family! What a way to celebrate Bday! I should say, my daughter is so lucky!  Sanjeev was very helpful always!  we have disturbed him at odd hours (like 11 PM) to clarify the route to the taxi driver.</p>
			<p><strong>The pottery tour:</strong><br>
				We are happy that we took this tour!  We are  cherishing the memories of roaming in potters village. We feel that the time we spent  is worthy and useful! What an insight we got! Since it was pre-Diwali season, We could smell the fresh diyas on making. It was such a  delight to sight the hundreds of Diyas spread out!<br>
				<br>
				Piyush is excellent  and full of Josh, taking us into potter's homes and look into their works. We roamed on the streets, stopped to look at the potter's houses - walls made up with pots and mud! Saw them making pots, diyas, pot lids etc. Witnessed the raw mud being filtered, soaked and finally going into the potter's hands! Finally, we tried our hands too! Nice experience! <br>
				Our wishes to Piyush! Thanks for suggesting this tour to us! <br>
				<br>
				We still talk about Pottery tour to our friends here (who ask abt our Delhi trip) and they are very eager to sign up when they travel to Delhi.</p>
			<p><strong>The Sunset hike:</strong><br>
				Very adventurous and thrilling indeed! Since we got delayed, we could not do the usual hiking as they do! But, Had a nice time. In some areas I feel it is really risky - esp for senior citizens and kids. We could mingle with the locals and know the culture.  As part of the package, they were generous to offer us dinner, which was yummy. One hour ride from the Metro station to the village was tiresome - in open share auto on bumpy road!</p>
			<p><strong>Overall:</strong> <br>
				We are happy happy happy, exploring Delhi thru IU.  Your tips and suggestions were very very useful and saved a lot of time and money! As you suggested, we used Metro mostly  which was fast and convenient, esp saved us from pollution! <br>
				We felt safe and peaceful at the homestay. <br>
				<br>
				This trip has changed my thinking on North India and I started looking into other destinations of IU. From the stay, exploring the monuments/city - everything went on so good and pleasant!  Wishing you all success!

		<h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
			<p class="mrgT25">We  recommend taking public transport during your stay in Delhi, to ensure that  both your carbon footprint and costs remain low; the Delhi Metro connects most  nooks and crannies of Delhi that you&rsquo;d like to see.</p>
			<p class="mrgT25"><strong>How this trip makes a difference:</strong></p>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<ul class="listing">
				<li>The  accommodation offered on this trail is a family-run homestay, giving you a  chance to interact closely with your hosts and understand the culture and  traditions of the region.</li>
				<li>The  guided trip to Pottery Village on day 2 directly benefits nine village  families, and a part of the revenue is channeled to a village development fund  for the overall development of the local community.</li>
				<li>The  guided trip to Little Tibet on day 3 is offered in collaboration with the  Tibetan Youth Congress, to help preserve Tibet&rsquo;s unique art, culture and  traditions.</li>
				<li>The  Pottery Village and Little Tibet trips give you the chance to interact with the  local craftsmen, and buy souvenirs directly from them.</li>
				<li>The  sunset walk in the pristine lakes of Delhi is organized in collaboration with  an organization working to develop clean technology, handicrafts, and  sustainable income sources within the village, which was hit by the mining ban  in the region. The walk directly contributes revenue to village families  involved in facilitating it, and indirectly to the upliftment of the entire  community.</li>
				<li>The  revenues generated from this trail are reinvested to further the cause of  responsible travel in the region and in India.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<p class="mrgT25"><strong>How you can make a difference on this trip:</strong></p>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<ul class="listing">
				<li>While staying in the homestay, take the time to interact with your hosts  and think of yourself as a guest at a family home. Please don&rsquo;t expect room  service!</li>
				<li>Carry a good water bottle and ask to refill drinking water at the  homestays. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
				<li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little  plastic as possible.</li>
				<li>What you wear has an impact – dress appropriately, especially when  visiting the villages on the outskirts of Delhi.</li>
				<li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public  places.</li>
				<li>Local food is great. Try it as much as possible and avoid packaged food.  Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting  it.</li>
				<li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs,  especially in public places.</li>
				<li>Seek permission before photographing people, so their privacy is  respected.</li>
				<li>Do not pluck any medicinal plants and flowers, and do not disturb the  wildlife. </li>
