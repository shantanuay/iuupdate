				<p class="aligncenter">India   Untravelled is our quest to help travellers discover a side of India   that not many people have experienced before. Our destinations lie in   rural parts of India   with untouched natural beauty, where hospitality comes innately to the   people and a traditional, earthy way of life can still be experienced.</p>
				<p class="aligncenter">As   you set off the beaten path, our rural homestays &amp; farmstays let   you discover the vibrant culture of India’s villages, indulge in   delectable local cuisines, uncover ancient traditions, rejuvenate your   spirit with the region’s folk music &amp; dances, discuss local legends   &amp; stories around a bonfire, and explore centuries old indigenous art   forms</p>
				<p class="aligncenter">At   many of our destinations, you might be one of the few tourists in the   region, and will get a chance to interact closely with the local   communities, hosts, cooks and craftspeople. You'll love getting away   from the crowds of the cities, and unwinding amid nature, in a safe   &amp; comfortable environment. At the same time, the revenue that your   visits generate will help support and sustain the local communities,   their heritage, culture, traditions and art forms.</p>
				<p class="aligncenter">India   Untravelled is a social enterprise that aims to bridge the digital   marketing gap between socially responsible tourism offerings in rural   parts of India, and urban travellers looking for authentic travel   experiences. </p>

				<p ><strong>Promoting travel as a lifestyle.</strong> </p>
				<p class="aligncenter"><em>&ldquo;Instead of wondering  when your next vacation is, maybe you ought to set up a life you don&rsquo;t need to  escape from.&rdquo; </em><br>
					<em>~ Seth Godin</em></p>
				<p class="aligncenter">We think of travel, not as a break from life, but as  life itself. To be on the road in search of new experiences is one of the best  ways to discover who you are &amp; how far you can stretch yourself, to get to know  people who's world is much different from yours, to come to respect the natural  diversity our planet has to offer, and to find the courage to do the things you  love. As fellow travellers, we would hate for travel experiences to be  constrained by lack of money, time, accurate information or encouragement, so  at India Untravelled, we aspire to carve out travel experiences that are  affordable, accessible, experiential and responsible, and we go all out to  reach you in the comfort of your social networks (Facebook, Twitter et al) to encourage  you to travel.</p>

					Sifti Dhillon, Owner (Marketing and PR)</strong></p>
					<p class="aligncenter">
					Sifti caught the travel bug early on from her parents. Though born in Delhi, she spent a few years in Chennai as a child, which helped her understand the sheer diversity in culture and the variety of experiences India had to offer. She has travelled across the country over the years, from the barren, mystical mountains of Ladakh to the white sand beaches in Andaman. Though the journey never seems to end, she now calls Chandigarh home. Her love for travel led her to take a break from a career in education, and paved the way to India Untravelled.</p>

					<p class="aligncenter">
					Srikala has been interested in travel and tourism ever since she has been in school. Brought up in Mumbai, she caught the travel bug from her parents who love to explore places themselves. Geography is her favourite subject and she has done plenty of research in the area for her various projects.</p>

<p>She loves to explore new places, learn about varied cultures and feels that life is one big journey and that there is never a limit to learning. What best way can one learn but through travel!</p>

					<p class="aligncenter">Shivya works as a responsible travel consultant, helping scout sustainable accommodations and community tourism initiatives for India Untravelled. Her journey in the tourism industry began with a stint at the Singapore Tourism Board, where she helped develop the board’s global social media strategy. In 2011, she quit her job in pursuit of a nomadic life, and began traveling the world slowly, responsibly and often solo. She was instrumental in the early days of India Untravelled as its co-founder, and in her new role as a freelance consultant, she has worked on sustainable travel projects in Ecuador and the Indian Himalayas.</p>

				<p class="aligncenter">Siddharth  carries a bit of many places in him; a small town in Uttar Pradesh, Bombay,  Singapore, the French Riviera, and now Delhi. His tryst with the banking and  finance industry ended in the realization of alternative interests, including  travelling, Indian politics, and energy security. He saw India with a new lens  after spending more than 6 years abroad, and travelling in rural India  extensively upon his return. India Untravelled symbolizes his newfound love for  his country, one that he hopes everyone who travels in India can experience. His  itchy feet have taken him across Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and  he continues his adventures in India, revelling in the unpredictability of the  road. </p>

				<p class="h1"><strong>Homestays.</strong></p>
				<p><em>&quot;A man travels the world over in search of what he needs, and  returns home to find it.&quot;<br>
					~ George Moore</em></p>
				<p class="aligncenter">We first experienced a homestay in the hinterlands of Vietnam, for lack  of an alternative, and were moved by the gracious hospitality of a Vietnamese  family we didn&rsquo;t even have a common language with. Fast-forward a few years; the  experience of magnanimous Punjabi hospitality in a small <em>pind </em>of Punjab sparks the birth of India Untravelled. We take it  upon us to convince travellers to experiment with accommodation options  different from regular hotels or resorts; these are typically home stays or  farm stays offered by native families or communities, that offer you the chance  to interact closely with your hosts and be part of the local lifestyle of the  region, while offering basic (and sometimes luxurious) urban comforts. We  personally handpick each of our partners, based on the authenticity &amp;  beauty of the experience, their location &amp; accessibility, and their  suitability to the needs of any urban traveller (western style loos at the bare  minimum). We then go all out to tell travel enthusiasts about our findings.</p>
				<p class="h1"><strong>Responsible Travel.</strong></p>
				<p><em>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re traveling, you are what you are  right there and then. People don&rsquo;t have your past to hold against you. No  yesterdays on the road.&rdquo; <br>
					~ William Least Heat Moon</em></p>
				<p class="aligncenter">There is a lot of jargon out there about climate  change and environmental degradation that we don&rsquo;t understand, and it&rsquo;s hard to  validate any of it from the comfort of our own homes &amp; offices. Travelling  changes that. Take a summer road trip from Delhi to Himachal and the forest  fires in our alpine forests will alarm you. Trace the journey of the River  Ganga from its glacial source in the Himalayas, down through Rishikesh &amp;  Haridwar, and you&rsquo;ll feel sorry for the dismal brown color it acquires. Hike up  into the Shivaliks and their dry barren slopes will tug at your heart. You  don&rsquo;t need to have a masters degree in science to see the impact of our actions  on our natural resources. What if small changes in the way we travel could make  a big different to the beauty of our world? </p>
				<p class="aligncenter">It is with this assumption that we choose to work with  partners whose efforts make a conscious difference to the ecology and community  of a region, and aim to inspire our travellers to make small changes in their  travel style, like choosing to take public transport and carrying a good  refillable water bottle rather than buying &amp; disposing numerous plastic  mineral water bottles.</p>
				<p class="h1"><strong>Solo Travel.</strong></p>
				<p><em>&ldquo;Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that  you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away  from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream.  Discover.&rdquo;<br>
					~ Mark Twain</em></p>
				<p class="aligncenter">Our co-founder Shivya is a strong advocate for  travelling solo, and was featured in 2012 by New Woman India magazine as an  intrepid female traveller. She&rsquo;ll tell you that there is nothing quite as  liberating and empowering as knowing that you have the confidence to travel all  by yourself, make friends with strangers, and experience the world on your own  terms. The idea of travelling alone may not appeal to everyone, and to those it  does, it is perfectly normal to feel anxious before your first solo trip. At  India Untravelled, we actively encourage solo travellers to join group trips  organized from time to time, as a first step into the world of single holidays.  We also take it upon us to ensure that our partner destinations &amp; itinerary  trails are perfectly safe for solo travellers, and filled with interactive  experiences.</p>
