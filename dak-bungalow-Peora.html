                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs_overview_dakBungalow.jpg" align="right">
                        <p>The Kumaon belt of Uttarakhand, majestically nestled in the Himalayas, is littered with several small mountain villages with enchanting views of the snow-clad Nanda Devi &amp; Trishul peaks. Peora is one such small Kumaoni hamlet
                            with traditional tiled-roof village huts sparsely scattered on the slopes of its contoured valleys, surrounded by dense pine forests. Mountain life in this region revolves around fruit cultivation, including apple, chestnut,
                            walnut, plum, peach, apricot and pear. In the close-knit community of Peora where everyone knows everyone else, a slow-paced life is interspersed with colourful mountain festivities.</p>
                        <p>The Dak Bungalow (Bangla) at Peora is a magnificent old British inspection bungalow built in 1905 along the silk route, on what was the Kathgodam-Almora-Bageshwar bridle road.  After years of dilapidation, the bungalow was leased
                            by Pradeep &amp; Shubha from the District Board in 2005, and refurbished as a homestay. Its original architecture, walls, fireplaces, wooden ceilings and grand verandas were retained, offering an indulgence in colonial royalty,
                            homely hospitality &amp; panoramic Himalayan views.</p>
                        <p>Nature enthusiasts, bird lovers &amp; photographers will find enough to feast their eyes on, from the colors of the Blue Magpie, to countryside village walks through colourful pine forests, to the fascinating night sky with myriad
                            stars and lights of the Almora town across the valley. The more adventurous can trek into the surrounding mountains, building their own trails. Various long-term volunteering opportunities are available at Aarohi, a local NGO
                            neighbouring Satoli that Pradeep &amp; Shubha are part of.</p>

                        <p>Shubha is an excellent cook! Simple home-made breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner can be provided on request, and sharing a meal with your hosts while hearing stories of their lives in the mountains in an essential part of the Dak Bungalow
                            experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>Breakfast typically consists of Indian or continental dishes, and Shubha&rsquo;s Aloo-Tikki burgers are a specialty. Lunch &amp; dinner is simple, delicious Indian or Continental vegetarian fare, made from seasonal vegetables.
                            Neighbouring orchards are a source for plums, apricots, peaches, pears, and apples in summer, and lemons and <em>Malta</em> orange in winter. Home-made jams and jellies, and fruit leathers are a speciality here!</p>
                        <p>You also have the option of cooking your own meals using the kitchen facilities available in your room. For lunch, you can walk up to one of the small roadside shops and ask for food, which is prepared freshly on order. A hot plate
                            of Maggi in the balcony of Mama&rsquo;s shop, overlooking the pine-fringed valley below, is heavenly.</p>
                        <p>Pradeep brews his own fruit wines, and will be happy to let you try some!</p>

                        <h3>Location</h3>
                        <p>Peora is a small mountain village located in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. Almora is the closest big town, 28 km away. The nearest railway station is at Kathgodam and the nearest bus stop is at Haldwani. And from these places,
                            Peora is about a 3-hour (80 -85 kms) drive by car, and taxis can be arranged for pickup.</p>
                        <p>The nearest domestic airport is at Dehradun (approx. 290 km) and international airport at Delhi (approx. 350 km).</p>
                        <h4>Best time to visit</h4>
                        <p>Peora is good for a visit all round the year. In the summer, the days are warm and mornings &amp; evenings pleasant, making it an ideal place to escape the city heat and the crowds of popular hill stations. Winters are typically
                            cold and September to March is the best time to soak in the views of the snow-capped Himalayan peaks. It snows but not in every winter.</p>
                        <p>Monsoon season paints the valley and the forests a lush green, and the smell of fresh wet earth dominates the air, making it a delight to spend time in this quaint hamlet.</p>
                        <h4>Food and cooking:</h4>
                        <p> The rooms come with a functional kitchenette, and guests are encouraged to cook on their own. Meals can be served in the host kitchen; prior notice is encouraged considering their commitment to the local NGO.</p>

                        <p><br> &ldquo;The place was incredible. Mr. Pradeep was very nice and accommodating, and went out of his way to ensure we had a good time. The views and the accommodation itself was very comfortable - all in all it was a great experience!<br>

                        <div class="sep"></div>

                        <p>&ldquo;We simply loved the homestay, Pradeep uncle and his wife (whose name I'm forgetting..Shubha, was it??) and perhaps, the list might go on endlessly. I must say this comes closest to an ideal experience of a homestay. I've
                            had many so far but nothing beats this. And I honestly don't know much about my friends as I can't speak for them, but I, for sure, did not return empty handed. All the stories that both of them shared, of how they built the
                            place and about their lives in general, have managed to change something in me and its all positive. Such an experience is a rarity I can bet. We loved every bit of our time there. Thank you for a helping us plan out such a
                            fine experience. We look forward to our next holiday planning with you soon. :) <br>

                            &ldquo;Our stay at Dak Bunglow was wonderful and very comfortable. The hosts Pradeep Gupta and his wife Shobha are wonderful hosts. The place is beautiful and well maintained. We really enjoyed our time there. We would definitely give 4.5 out of 5 stars.<br>

                        <p>&ldquo;It was a lovely stay. The place is just perfect for both of us. The quietness &amp; the tranquilness of the place was just what we were looking for & much needed respite from the hectic lives we are living in Mumbai. The
                            hosts, Mr. Gupta &amp; his wife are extremely warm and their welcoming nature felt like we were home again. <br> We are definitely travelling back &amp; exploring the other properties that you guys have under your kitty. <br>                            India Untravelled is doing a fantastic job. <br>

                        <p>&ldquo;We really enjoyed our stay the Dak Bungalow. We loved it. Pradeep and Shubha were great hosts and were such knowledgeable people. We really enjoyed talking to them and sharing our experiences. The place was lovely, quiet
                            and had the old world charm that we were looking for, very confortable, neat and clean. The food was simple and tasty and since we are vegetarians we did not miss anything. Pradeep’s plum wine was great!<br> To sum up it was
                            a wonderful experience and we would love to visit them again. <br> All the best for your wonderful endeavour in promoting lesser known India in an ecological manner. <br>

                            to Mrs. Shobha to add my father and brother's name to her Aaloo tikki burger fan club. Everything is perfect and in good shape, food was great, property was well maintained, lovely hosts.<br> Looking forward to visit there

                        <p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;Our Kuamon hosts were brilliant, though the mattress at Peora was a little hard for our western bodies. Shubha and Pradeep responded promptly and gave us another mattress. Thoroughly enjoyed our time there with many walks
                            through villages and also some shopping with Pradeep. The food here was delicious.&rdquo;<br>

                        <p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;We loved the Dak Bungalow; and see ourselves going back there as time permits.<br>
                            <br> The Guptas are very nice and the property is immaculately kept. One thing to be mindful of is that the food is expensive, relative to what the Guptas are able to prepare. But then their rent rates are quite reasonable.
                            I'd personally encourage guests to cook themselves a lot more. That said, Dak Bungalow is a fantastic place.&rdquo;<br>

                        <p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;We did have an absolutely relaxing and wonderful time. There was not one single thing that we liked , but several small things that made it great!! - Shubha's food (she even made chaat on my request as it was my husbands
                            birthday), they organised a pahari meal as we wanted to try that out, organised a trip to mukteshwar, told me where to shop for what and were very helpful and friendly without being intrusive.<br>
                            <br> Two things we would have liked to know in advance - It takes a full 3 hours from kathgodam station, not 2 to 2.5 hrs. Wish we had known that they encourage people to cook and have no help - would have planned to cook a
                            few meals myself in that case.<br>

                            <br> Your hospitality has been perfect &amp; homely. But more than that, your story &amp; your way of life has been an inspiration. The sincerity with which you both share your home and your lives has been moving.<br>
                            <br> I sincerely hope our paths cross again. But even if they don’t, I will definitely share my Dak Bungalow experience with friends.&rdquo; <strong> ~ Nicholas Foo, travelled with friends in November 2012</strong></p>

                            <br> It has truly been a soul-searching trip for me. I am truly amazed and inspired by the choices you all have taken and it definitely is heart warming to know that there are choices that one could take to bring ourselves
                            closer to being human. Thanks to the both of you – you have showed us the way.&rdquo; <strong> ~ Dawa Pakimo, travelled with friends in November 2012</strong></p>

                            <br> Dak Bungalow will always have a special place in our hearts.

                        <h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
                        <p>Pradeep &amp; Shubha moved to the mountains of Kumaon in 2003, to work with Aarohi, an NGO dedicated to the causes of education, healthcare &amp; livelihoods in the region. The Dak Bungalow homestay is an effort to conserve its
                            ancient British architecture, and offer travellers a colonial experience amid the Himalayas. Pradeep &amp; Shubha personally host all guests.</p>
                        <p>Below are some tips to practice responsible travel while in Peora:</p>
                        <ul class="listing">
                            <li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as possible.</li>
                            <li>Do not leave behind any non-biodegradable waste.</li>
                            <li>What you wear has an impact – environmentally and culturally – dress ethically and appropriately.</li>
                            <li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
                            <li>Carry a good water bottle. Purified drinking water is available at Amraee Guest House for re-filling your bottles. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
                            <li>Local food is great. Try it as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
                            <li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs, especially in public places</li>
                            <li>Seek permission before photographing people, so their privacy is respected.</li>
                            <li>Do not pluck any medicinal plants &amp; flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife.</li>
                        </ul>
