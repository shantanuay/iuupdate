					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs_overview_Innisfree-Forest-Estate.jpg" alt="Innisfree  Forest Estate" align="right">
					<p>Innisfree  Forest Estate is the mountain home of Lat and his elder brother Dway - descendants  of Kumaon&rsquo;s royal Chand Dynasty and a Burmese princess. Together with Lat&rsquo;s  Latvian wife Julia and their mother Aunty Kiran, they warmly welcome travellers  into their home and lives. This is a family full of love, laughter and stories  of the days of yore. And their house is the abode of spectacular mountain  sunrises and sunsets, and breath-taking views of the snow-hooded Himalayas on  clear days. Perfect for solitude seekers, solo travellers, writers, artists,  and anyone looking for tranquillity, inspiring vistas, long walks, and lots of  good food and conversation. </p>
					<p>Named  after a poem by the Irish poet WB Yeats, Innisfree is located in the  picturesque little mountain town of Nathuakhan, a 2.5 hour drive from the nearest  railway station at Kathgodam. Lose yourself amidst acres of deodar and oak  forests, feast on fresh produce from the estate&rsquo;s own organic farm, join your  charming hostess for a walk through postcard mountain villages and valleys all  the way to Mukteshwar, while away time gazing at the sheer beauty of the  Himalayas, chat with the friendly locals, experiment with fusion recipes in the  host kitchen or prepare your own food in your outdoor farm kitchenette,  stargaze on clear dark nights, dine with fellow travellers, and let the family  regale you with stories of mountain living!</p>

					<h3>Stay</h3>
					<img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs_stay_Innisfree-Forest-Estate.jpg"  alt="The family house" align="right">
					<p>The family house at Innisfree Forest Estate was built more than two  decades ago with recycled stone and wood, and blends in perfectly with the surrounding  forests and mountains. Three double rooms are on offer to travellers in the  family house – simple, cozy, aesthetic, airy, with modern amenities – a chance  to mingle closely with the family while having your own space.</p>
					<p>An independent farm cottage stands amid the vegetable farm, a 10-minute  walk downhill from the main house, offering adventurous families and couples  their own private retreat in the wilderness. It comes equipped with a double  bedroom, a small indoor kitchenette, an open-air kitchen, and an exclusive  bathroom a few feet away. Running cold water is available, and an old fashioned  hamam can be used to heat water. To join the family for meals, you must walk up  to the main house. Best suited for young couples, long term rentals and those looking  for complete solitude in the mountains.</p>
					<p>Whether you stay in the family house or your independent farm cottage,  you are welcome to have your meals with the host family on the long wooden  dining table, enjoy high tea with sunsets in the verandah, and lose yourself  amid the old books of the quaint little library.</p>
					<p>You wake up to the sweet chirping of birds, gorgeous views of the  surrounding mountains, and endless possibilities of the adventures the  mountains might lead you to.</p>

					<h3>Reviews</h3>
					
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;TWe are parents of a two year old, have travelled and camped a lot in india and since we had a baby, we travel every 2months nearly. Our little boy loves it. So we went to this gorgeous place called innsfree in Nathua khan ( Uttaranchal ). It's been the best homestay till date, Julia is a fantastic host. We stayed at the cottage away from the main house right on the hill farm with our own fire place, and looking out from the cottage was just the hills and clouds and sky and greens (no construction at all) - that was always my dream location.The food was awesome, think I would have gained a few kilos if it wasn't for our walks :). Highly recommend innsfree to people who want to get away from the crowds.&rdquo; <br>
						<strong>~ Shweta, travelled with her family in October 2014.</strong> </p>
						<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;Thanks very much for everything. Innisfree was great; we liked the overall experience a lot.<br>
						Pros:<br>
						The farm is terrific; the cottage is particularly excellent; amenities like linen, cutlery, kitchenware all thoughtfully placed<br>
						The dinner, lunch and breakfast spreads were generous and sumptuous - arguably unlike any other place in this segment. Julia and Layt are very engaging and attentive hosts.<br>
						<br>
						A couple of things to look out for:<br>
						It is worth disclosing at the outset that the double rooms are literally a homestay i.e. one shares the roof with the hosts - which guests may not anticipate at the time of booking. 
						Worth also telling guests beforehand about the number of dogs. We like dogs and thus had no problem with them; others may not be. 
						All told, it's a place well-worth visiting particularly for families. It will do seriously well as time goes by.&rdquo; <br>

				<h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
					<p>Lat, Julia and Aunty Kiran make all efforts to blend in with their  pristine surroundings. They have preserved the oak and deodar forests in their  backyard for decades, and built the family home and the farm cottage entirely  with recycled or locally sourced stone and wood. The organic farm on the estate  uses minimal pesticides and no chemicals, growing everything from vegetables  and fruits to herbs, and supplies most of the food served to travellers; the  rest is sourced from local growers.</p>
					<p>Wastage is minimized; biodegradable waste is used to make compost for the  organic farm, while non-biodegradable waste is recycled as much as possible.</p>
					<p>Below are some tips to travel  responsibly while in Nathuakhan:</p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Carry  a good water bottle. Filtered water from the mountain spring is available at the  house for refilling your bottle. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral  water bottles.</li>
						<li>Pack  your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as  possible.</li>
						<li>Do  not litter or leave behind any non-biodegradable waste. Carry it to the cities  where better waste management systems are in place.</li>
						<li>What  you wear has an impact. Dress appropriately, especially when you walk into the  villages.</li>
						<li>Respect  the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
						<li>Experiment  with local and fusion food served from the host kitchen, or prepare your own in  your farm cottage&rsquo;s kitchenette. Ask for modifications in the food according to  your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
						<li>Avoid  excessive consumption of alcohol, especially in public places. </li>
						<li>Seek  permission before photographing people, so as to respect their privacy.</li>
						<li>Please  do not pluck any plants and flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife.</li>
					</ul>
