			<h3>Trip Overview</h3>
			<p>Dal Lake has been a long standing witness to the times that Kashmir has been through. India Untravelled invites you to live on this historical lake, in a warm and cozy houseboat run by a family who has lived on the Dal-Lake for many generations.  Your houseboat is a traditional dwelling of Kashmiri people who live on the lake and has a beautiful view of the iconic Shankaracharya temple hill.</p>
			<p>Mohammed Sultan Badyari, built the houseboat himself in the 1980s. Today, with the help of his wife and daughters, he personally manages the houseboat and the visitors. The family is well versed with the region and the best local sights and are eager to share their hospitality with the travellers through their stories and food.</p>
			<p>Travel back in time to an era when Srinagar was known for its beauty, friendly people and peaceful environs. Ride on a Shikara to the holy shrine Hazratbal, let a local take you through the lanes of the Old city, letting you in on the best places to shop and eat. Visit the stunning valley of Yousmarg, a pine forest away from the usual touristy spots. Above all let the valley embrace you as one of its own. Heaven is here!</p>

				<h3>Trip Highlights</h3>

			<h3>Brief Itinerary</h3>
			<p>The Life in a Houseboat trail is perfect for those who want to live with the locals of Kashmir and experience their warm hospitality not to mention an access to their best kept secrets, places the regular tourist seldom know about. This trail can be customized based on your travel days and interests.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Days 1: Meet the family. Take in the views of the Dal Lake</strong></p>
			<p>The <em>Life in a Houseboat Experience</em> can start at the Srinagar Airport, which is connected to the rest of India by domestic flight connections. A pick up can be organized by a cab and you are transferred to the houseboat on Dal Lake which is going to be your home for the next few days. The rooms are furnished with traditional Kashmiri furniture, made of walnut wood.</p>
			<p>Mohd Sultan is assisted by his wife Rafiqa who will tickle your tastebuds with her expertise in the local cuisine. Their daughters, Afshan and Heena, love sharing stories with visitors. The host family lives in a cottage next to the houseboat so you can enjoy both convenience of having them around and privacy of being alone.</p>
			<p>In the evening one can opt for a short shikara ride to take in the life and beauty the city has to offer.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Day 2: Day Trip: Guided tour of the Old and New City</strong></p>
			<p>Today a local guide will accompany you to the old and new parts of the city of Srinagar. The trip becomes all the more interesting as you take the local transport with him to reach the places or mostly walk on foot. Visit the Shah-E-Hamdan mosque, Jama-E-Masjid to learn about the architecture and culture. In the market place walk past the old trade shops of copper, textiles and dryfruits and shop a bit. Have a hearty lunch at one of the famous eateries. Take a stroll around Raj-bagh, the Jehlum river and cross the foot bridges that provide a stunning view of the city and be among locals. Admire both old and new city scenes the city has to offer at your leisure.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Days 3: Shikara Trip to Hazratbal</strong></p>
			<p>Excitement knows no bounds as today we will embark on a full day shikara trip to Hazratbal. The ride from the houseboat to the holy shrine of Hazratbal is scenic and one comes across many water village landscapes on the way there. On reaching Hazratbal you are guided to the mosque and the surrounding market. A picnic lunch is arranged at Char Chinar island. It is a scenic island between the Hazratbal bank and the famous Mughal gardens of Shalimar and Nishat. On the way back take a different route and sail past old city landscapes of pandit houses.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Day 4: Day trip to Yousmarg</strong></p>
			<p>Yousmarg valley is at a short distance from Srinagar. Travel on Kashmir's mountain roads in a quiet part of the province and enjoy the views of western Himalayas. One can enjoy beautiful scenery and go on a short day trek through the pine forest. One can also visit the river area called dooghganga, 'doogh' means "milk" and 'ganga' means "river", the doogh ganga is named so as it appears milk is flowing through the mountains and big rocks. The sound of gushing water in a quiet corner of Kashmir truly is stuff memorable times are made of.</p>

			<p><strong>Day 5: Cook a Kashmiri Dish</strong></p>
			<p>On you last day in Srinagar, take a bit of Kashmir with you. The hostess, Rafiqa will guide you as you assist her in cooking a kashmiri dish in her kitchen. Enjoy the meal chatting with them and take along some happy memories of the valley and the warm people who live here.</p>
			<p>Transfer to Airport for your flight back home.</p>
