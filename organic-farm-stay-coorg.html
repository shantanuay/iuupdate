					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs_overview_croog.jpg" align="right" alt="The huts at sunset">The best way to experience a place is to see it through the lens of the locals, and in Karnataka’s coffee country, we offer just that.</p>
					<p>Coorg (traditionally called Kodagu) offers a great introduction to village life in Karnataka. Scattered amid its richly forested terrain and lush coffee estates, are quaint little villages with rice paddies, maize fields, small streams, and seasonal waterfalls. Chikkabattageri is one such village, where time slows down to let you appreciate the little joys of life – watching silver butterflies dance above the fields, cycling along sleepy hamlets and picturesque coffee plantations, and getting slushy in the rice paddies!</p>
					<p>Far from the popular townships, in a typical Coorgi village near Kushalnagar, a local family has set up an organic oasis by their rice paddies. Five beautifully handcrafted huts overlook the paddies and the hills beyond, their interiors designed with much love using only naturally or locally sourced materials – pumpkin lamp shades, earthen pots, biodegradable soaps, bamboo decor, and such. You wake up to the chirping of birds and colourful butterflies, indulge in delicious organic fusion Coorgi-South Indian food, hear tales of the jungle tribes of Coorg, and discover its lesser known sights and sounds.</p>
					<p>Outdoor enthusiasts can ride the mountain bikes to the nearby villages or hike into the surrounding forests. Coffee connoisseurs can trace the journey of coffee from seed (leaves?) to cup. Culinary enthusiasts can learn Kodava recipes passed on for generations. You can drive the scenic route to peaceful Tibetan monasteries; meet a hobbyist beekeeper to taste the tastiest honeys; put on your gum boots and help sow or harvest the rice paddies; or just lie back on your balcony and soak in the beauty of life on the countryside.</p>

					<h3>Stay</h3>
					<p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs_stay_croog.jpg" align="right" alt="Interiors of the huts">Accommodation is provided in five handcrafted huts, their roofs fitted with recycled fiberboard and covered with canvas to survive the rains. Each hut comes with a balcony and lounge chairs, which overlooks the farm and the rice paddies beyond; a perfect spot to watch butterflies and birds in the early mornings and evenings.</p>
					<p>The rooms are beautifully furnished with all things naturally or locally sourced - comfortable wooden beds, wooden coat racks, bamboo lampshades, and wall paintings made by village artists in Kerala. All basic amenities are provided in the attached bathroom; western toilets, shower and steel buckets, biodegradable soaps, and natural shampoo. A small part of the bathroom roof is made of fiber, to allow natural light to pour in during the day.</p>
					<p>The open lounge and dining area is made with natural hay roofing, with lounge chairs, lampshades carved out of pumpkin, and a small vegetable garden in front.</p>

				<h3>Food &amp; Drinks</h3>
					<p><img src="images/tabsMain_image/tabs_food_croog.jpg" align="right" alt="Rice dumplings, chutneys, curries and phulkas for dinner">Brace yourself for some delicious vegetarian fare! Breakfast consists of traditional <em>akki rotis</em> (made of rice flour and heated over coals) served with honey, <em>jaggery</em>, and home-cooked chutneys. <em>Neer dosas</em> are another breakfast specialty in Coorg, cooked with rice flour and water (little or no oil), and served with coconut chutney. Continental dishes like bread, eggs, jam, butter and cheese are also available.</p>
					<p>Dinner consists of a mix of Coorgi and South Indian dishes, prepared with seasonal vegetables and ingredients – rice dumplings, <em>phulkas</em>, rice cakes or rice noodles are served with vegetable curries, banana and jackfruit chutneys, and rasam. Local food is traditionally spicy, powered with bird eye chillies, which are a healthy alternative to commercial chillies; the cooks are happy to modify the spice levels as per your taste buds! </p>
					<p>Payassum is traditionally served for dessert, in different kinds of preparations, like rice payassum flavored with jaggery, jaggery payassum flavoured with cinnamon. Difficult as it might be, make sure you leave space for the warm, sumptuous deserts!</p>
					<p>All food is prepared fresh in the in-house kitchen, and most local dishes are cooked in earthen pots, on a traditional <em>chulha</em>-style appliance with coal fire. As far as possible, organic ingredients are used in the cooking, including organic oil, rice, wheat flour, vegetables and fruits.</p>
					<p>Breakfast and dinner are served from the kitchen, and lunch can be prepared on special request.</p>

					<h4>Best time to visit</h4>
					<p>Coorg is good for a trip all round the year.</p>
					<p>During winter (November to February), the days are warm, while the early mornings and evenings are chilly. This is an eventful time in Coorg, when the rice paddies are harvested during the harvest festival. There’s no joy like warming up over a cup of hot Coorgi coffee over a cool winter night.</p>
					<p>In the monsoon season (July to August), the rains lash the coffee country and waterfalls appear in the coffee plantations. Everything is lush green, and if off-roading is your thing, there’s no better time to visit!</p>
					<p>During summer (April to June), the days warm up considerably, but mornings and evenings remain pleasant.</p>
					<div class="clearfix"></div>
					<h4>Things to note:</h4>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Cash and ATMs:&nbsp;Only cash is accepted at the farm. The nearest  ATM is located in the town of Kushalnagar, 9 km away.</li>
						<li>Food: Only organic vegetarian food is  available.</li>
						<li>Bathrooms:&nbsp;Each  room comes with an attached bathroom, with running hot water and western style  toilets.</li>
						<li>Electricity:&nbsp;Power  cuts are infrequent but please be prepared by carrying torches and spare  batteries as needed.</li>

					<h3>Reviews</h3>
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;The stay was great. Narendra is a great host. I'll be back there soon. No room for improvement. Food too was excellent. Thanks for the great stay! My first experience with your team was very good.&rdquo;<br>
						<strong> ~ Priya Chetty, travelled in January 2016</strong></p>
									<div class="sep"></div>
					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;The cottage was awesome and Narendra gave us a warm welcome. We had very delicious food of different varieties. The Paddy fields which was surrounded were amazing scenic beauty. It was like we were cut for a few days from the city or town tensions. As a part of our anniversary they made a special arrangement for cake cutting. Narendra and his Family was one the best hosts we have had.<br>
						<strong> ~ Kaushik Gampa, travelled in August 2015</strong></p>

					<p class="quote quoteTxt">&ldquo;The place is surrounded by lush green paddy fields the added advantage here is it has only 5 cottages ensuring unperturbed serenity with only chirping sounds of birds and creaking sounds of trees. The cottages are cosy and comfortable with urban comforts and an organic touch! Drinking water is served in earthen pots, brass mug and bucket for bathing. It really took me back in time reminding me of my castor oil and soap nut powder bathing days. Our host Narendra and Shalini were a very friendly and warm couple who ensured we were comfortable and always ready to accommodate.&rdquo;<br>

				<h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
					<p>Narendra’s passionately believes in all things organic, and it reflects in every little part of the farm. The huts are handcrafted with recycled fiberboard roofs, covered with canvas, and furnished with locally or naturally sourced décor and amenities. The lounge area is built with hay roofs, the pathways are fitted with terracotta tiles, and wild plants and flowers are nurtured all over the farm. All food provided on the farm is organically grown or sourced, including the oil, wheat flower, rice, vegetables and fruits.</p>
					<p>Solar power is being used for most electricity needs, with plans to erect a small wind turbine on the far end of the farm. An indigenous bioculture technology is being employed to recycle wastewater generated from the huts. The rice paddies are sustained without fertilizers or pesticides. </p>
					<p>Below are some tips to travel responsibly while in Coorg:</p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Pack your bags with environmentally friendly things. Carry as little plastic as possible.</li>
						<li>Do not leave behind any non-biodegradable waste.</li>
						<li>What you wear has an impact – environmentally and culturally – dress ethically and appropriately, especially when you visit the nearby villages and monasteries.</li>
						<li>Respect the local culture and refrain from physical intimacy in public places.</li>
						<li>Carry a good water bottle. Filtered water is available at the house for refilling your bottle. Refrain from buying numerous plastic mineral water bottles.</li>
						<li>Local food is great. Try it as much as possible and avoid packaged food. Ask for modifications in the food according to your taste, instead of wasting it.</li>
						<li>Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and refrain from drugs, especially in public places.</li>
						<li>Seek permission before photographing people, so as to respect their privacy.</li>
						<li>Do not pluck any plants &amp; flowers, and do not disturb the wildlife.</li>
					</ul>
